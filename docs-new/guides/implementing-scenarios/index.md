# Guide: Implementing Common Scenarios

This section provides end-to-end examples and walkthroughs for implementing specific business scenarios using the D365 Agent SDK.

*(This section would contain individual markdown files for each scenario, absorbing content from the original `use_case_scenarios.md` and likely expanding on them.)*

**Examples:**

*   **[Automating Sales Follow-ups](./automating-sales-follow-ups.md):** Building an agent to automatically create tasks or send emails based on opportunity status changes.
*   **[Handling Customer Support Requests](./handling-support-requests.md):** Creating an agent to triage incoming support cases and provide initial responses.
*   **[Inventory Level Monitoring](./inventory-monitoring.md):** An agent that monitors stock levels and alerts relevant personnel.
*   *[Add more specific scenario examples here]*
