# Guide: Debugging and Logging

Effective debugging and logging are essential for developing and maintaining robust agent solutions. This guide covers techniques and tools available within or recommended for use with the D365 Agent SDK.

## Logging

*   **Configuring Logging Levels:** [How to set verbosity (e.g., Debug, Information, Warning, Error)]
*   **Log Providers:** [Integrating with common logging frameworks (e.g., Serilog, NLog, Azure Application Insights)]
    *   [Configuration examples]
*   **Interpreting SDK Logs:** [Key log messages or patterns generated by the SDK itself]
*   **Adding Custom Logs:** [Best practices for adding informative logs in partner code]

## Debugging

*   **Local Debugging:** [Steps for attaching a debugger (e.g., Visual Studio) to a running agent process]
*   **Debugging D365 Interactions:** [Techniques for inspecting API calls and responses]
    *   [Using tools like Fiddler or browser developer tools]
    *   [Leveraging SDK logging]
*   **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**
    *   [Authentication errors]
    *   [Connectivity problems]
    *   [Data serialization issues]
    *   [Permission errors]

## Monitoring (If Applicable)

*   **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** [Connecting to Application Performance Management (APM) tools like Application Insights or Datadog]
*   **Key Metrics to Monitor:** [Performance counters, error rates, request latency]
