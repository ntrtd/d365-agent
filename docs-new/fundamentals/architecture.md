# SDK Architecture

This document provides a high-level overview of the D365 Agent SDK's architecture, focusing on aspects relevant to partner developers integrating the SDK.

*   **Core Engine:** [Description of the central processing part of the agent]
*   **D365 Connector:** [How the SDK interfaces with Dynamics 365 APIs (e.g., OData, specific service endpoints)]
*   **State Management:** [How the agent maintains conversation state or context, if applicable]
*   **Extensibility Points:** [Where partners can plug in custom logic, components, or middleware]
*   **Execution Flow:** [Diagram or description of how a typical request is processed through the SDK]

*(Consider adding a diagram here, e.g., using Mermaid)*
