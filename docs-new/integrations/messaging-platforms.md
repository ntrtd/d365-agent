# Integration: Messaging Platforms

Extend the reach of your D365 Agent by integrating it with popular messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.

*(This content will integrate details from `whatsapp.md`)*

## General Approach

Most integrations involve creating a bot or application on the target platform that acts as an intermediary. This bot receives messages from users on the platform and forwards relevant requests to your D365 Agent (usually via its API). The agent's response is then sent back through the platform bot to the user.

## Microsoft Teams

*   **Teams Bots:** Building a Bot Framework bot specifically for Teams.
*   **Calling Agent API:** The Teams bot calls your D365 Agent's API.
*   **Adaptive Cards:** Using Adaptive Cards to display rich responses from the agent within Teams.
*   **Authentication:** Handling user authentication within Teams and mapping it to D365 permissions if necessary.

## WhatsApp

*   **WhatsApp Business API:** Using the official API (often via providers like Twilio).
*   **Webhook:** Setting up a webhook endpoint (e.g., an Azure Function or Web API) that receives WhatsApp messages.
*   **Processing Messages:** The webhook logic parses the message and calls the D365 Agent API.
*   **Sending Replies:** Formatting the agent's response and sending it back via the WhatsApp Business API.

## Other Platforms (e.g., Slack)

*   **Platform SDKs/APIs:** Utilizing the specific platform's developer tools.
*   **Similar Patterns:** Typically involves creating a bot/app, handling incoming messages/events, calling the agent API, and formatting/sending responses.

## Considerations

*   **Message Formatting:** Adapting agent responses to the formatting capabilities of each platform.
*   **User Mapping:** Identifying the platform user and potentially mapping them to a D365 user/contact.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Respecting the API limits of the messaging platforms.
*   **Security:** Securing the webhook endpoints and API calls.
