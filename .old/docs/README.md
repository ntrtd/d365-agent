# D365-MCP: Unlocking Business Data for AI

## The Problem We Solve

Today's organizations face a critical challenge: valuable business data is locked inside complex systems like Dynamics 365, while AI assistants can't easily access this information.

    User -->|Must use complex UI| D365

    style AI fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D365 fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style Data fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Without standardization, each organization must build custom connectors for every AI system they want to use, creating:

- **High development costs** for each AI integration
- **Technical barriers** that prevent business users from leveraging AI
- **Siloed information** that limits AI effectiveness
- **Security vulnerabilities** from inconsistent implementation approaches

## Our Solution: A Universal Bridge

D365-MCP creates a standardized bridge between any AI system and Dynamics 365, unlocking business data with natural language.
