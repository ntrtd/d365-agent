# AI Interface to Dynamics Business Applications
## Leveraging Model Context Protocol on Azure

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a strategy to create and monetize an AI interface for Dynamics 365 business applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The solution will be deployed as a multi-tenant SaaS application on Azure, allowing customers to connect their Dynamics environments through a secure onboarding process. The integration will support both standard D365 OData interfaces and custom application extensions for enhanced capabilities.

## Business Opportunity

Organizations using Dynamics 365 face challenges in efficiently accessing, analyzing, and working with their business data. An AI interface can transform how users interact with these systems by:

1. Enabling natural language queries of business data
2. Automating routine operations and workflows
3. Providing intelligent insights and recommendations
4. Simplifying complex business processes
5. Making Dynamics data accessible to non-technical users

## Solution Architecture

### Overview

The proposed solution follows a layered architecture:
