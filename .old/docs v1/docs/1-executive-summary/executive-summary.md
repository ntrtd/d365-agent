# Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a strategy to create and monetize an AI interface for Dynamics 365 business applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The solution will be deployed as a multi-tenant SaaS application on Azure, allowing customers to connect their Dynamics environments through a secure onboarding process. The integration will support both standard D365 OData interfaces and custom application extensions for enhanced capabilities.

## Core Value Proposition

Organizations using Dynamics 365 face challenges in efficiently accessing, analyzing, and working with their business data. An AI interface can transform how users interact with these systems by:

1. Enabling natural language queries of business data
2. Automating routine operations and workflows
3. Providing intelligent insights and recommendations
4. Simplifying complex business processes
5. Making Dynamics data accessible to non-technical users

## Solution Overview

The proposed solution follows a layered architecture with:
- Multi-tenant core services for authentication, billing, and tenant management
- MCP server farm connecting to Dynamics OData endpoints and custom extensions
- AI services for LLM integration and orchestration
- Various client applications including web, mobile, and Teams interfaces

## Target Market

- Mid-sized Dynamics 365 customers
- Industries with complex data needs (manufacturing, healthcare, financial services)
- Organizations with limited in-house Dynamics expertise

## Business Model Highlights

- Tiered subscription model ($99-$299+/month)
- Usage-based components for LLM consumption and API requests
- Add-on services for custom development and integration
- Partner network with progressive revenue sharing (10-25%)
