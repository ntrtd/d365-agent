Thought for 1m 6s
In one sentence: Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open‑source, JSON‑RPC–based standard—sometimes called “USB‑C for AI”—that lets any large‑language‑model app plug into any external data source or tool through a lightweight client‑server handshake, replacing bespoke integrations with a common, vendor‑neutral layer.

Model Context Protocol

1. Why a new protocol was needed
Modern AI apps face an N × M problem: every model (N) must speak a different, hand‑rolled API to every tool or database (M) they want to use. 
Descope

MCP, announced by Anthropic in November 2024, solves this by defining one standard interface that any client and any server can reuse, slashing integration effort and maintenance. 
The Verge
whatismcp.com

Think of it as doing for AI what USB and Language‑Server Protocol did for hardware and IDEs, respectively. 
whatismcp.com
Model Context Protocol

2. Core architecture & message flow

Role	What it does	Example
Host	The UI where the user talks to an LLM	Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Mac app
Client	Maintains a 1‑to‑1 connection with each server	Built into the host
Server	Exposes Resources (context), Prompts (templates) and Tools (function calls)	GitHub server, PostgreSQL server
The host’s client opens a persistent connection, performs capability discovery, then the LLM calls any advertised tools via JSON‑RPC 2.0 requests; results stream back over STDIO or HTTP + Server‑Sent‑Events. 
Model Context Protocol
Descope
Model Context Protocol

Transport & format
JSON‑RPC 2.0 envelopes every call/response. 
Model Context Protocol

Two transports are specified: local STDIO for desktop workflows and HTTP + SSE for remote or cloud servers. 
Descope

Connection negotiation and progressive capability updates mirror the pattern pioneered by LSP. 
Model Context Protocol

3. Feature highlights
Resources – zero‑copy context injection (documents, schemas, embeddings). 
whatismcp.com

Tools – fully‑typed function calls the model can invoke, returning structured JSON. 
Model Context Protocol

Prompts – reusable, server‑hosted prompt templates that keep business logic near the data. 
Model Context Protocol

Sampling – an optional server‑side request for the model to think or branch recursively. 
Model Context Protocol

Progress, cancellation & logging built into the base spec for robust orchestration. 
Model Context Protocol

4. Growing ecosystem
Microsoft Copilot Studio now lets makers “Add an action → MCP server” so agent workflows inherit new tools automatically. 
Microsoft

Azure OpenAI & Chainlit demo code shows one‑line attachment of any MCP server to an OpenAI chat loop. 
Microsoft Tech Community

Hundreds of community servers and official SDKs (Python, TypeScript, C#, Java, Kotlin) live under the modelcontextprotocol GitHub org. 
GitHub
GitHub
GitHub

Early adopters include Replit, Codeium and Sourcegraph, while OpenAI’s agent SDK has a pending MCP bridge. 
The Verge
Simon Willison’s Weblog

Journalists at Axios call MCP “the hot new standard that glues AI to the rest of your software stack.” 
Axios

5. Security & limitations
Because servers can expose arbitrary code paths, prompt‑injection and data‑exfiltration attacks are real risks; Simon Willison highlights examples where a malicious server can read your WhatsApp history. 
Simon Willison’s Weblog

The spec therefore emphasises explicit user consent, granular permissions and sandboxing, but enforcement is left to implementers. 
Model Context Protocol

Analysts warn that, like any open protocol, monetisation may lag behind adoption, potentially slowing commercial support. 
Axios

6. Getting started quickly
Read the spec (updated 26 Mar 2025). 
Model Context Protocol

Spin up a server with the official Python SDK in three lines of code. 
GitHub

Attach it to a host (e.g., Claude Desktop → Settings ▸ Servers ▸ Add local server). 
Model Context Protocol

Inspect traffic with the open‑source MCP Inspector for debugging. 
Model Context Protocol

7. Outlook
Bloggers like Matt Webb argue that MCP is arriving just as organisations need an alternative to SEO‑centric customer journeys—making structured AI chat the new entry point to the web. 
interconnected.org

Whether MCP becomes the lingua franca for agent tooling will depend on security hardening and continued cross‑vendor support, but momentum in the past six months suggests it is already the front‑runner among open standards.

How d365 odata interface can be exposed via mcp
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 36 seconds
In short: you wrap Dynamics 365’s standard OData endpoints in a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that authenticates with Azure AD, then advertises every OData entity as a Resource and every create/update/delete operation as a Tool; once running, any MCP‑aware LLM (Claude, Copilot Studio, etc.) can browse or mutate D365 data with zero extra glue code. 
Microsoft Learn
GitHub
Gist
GitHub

1  How the pieces fit together
1.1 Dynamics 365 side
OData v4 endpoints already expose all tables/entities (e.g., /data/Customers?$select=AccountNum,Name) over HTTPS. 
Microsoft Learn

They accept OAuth 2.0 tokens issued by Azure AD; client‑credential flow is the norm for headless servers. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

1.2 MCP side
An MCP server is just a long‑running process that speaks JSON‑RPC 2.0 over stdio or HTTP + SSE, announces its capabilities, and responds to Resources, Tools and Prompts. 
GitHub
Gist

Ready‑made SDKs (Python, TypeScript) remove boilerplate. 
GitHub
GitHub

1.3 Bridging the two
You map “GET OData query” → Resource and “POST/PATCH/DELETE” → Tool and let your code translate between MCP’s JSON envelopes and D365’s OData JSON payloads. A community project already proves the pattern. 
GitHub

2  Step‑by‑step guide
2.1 Prerequisites
Azure AD app registration with Client ID, Client Secret and API permissions for Dynamics 365. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

msal (Python) or @azure/identity (Node) for token acquisition. 
Microsoft Learn

MCP SDK (pip install modelcontextprotocol or npm i @modelcontextprotocol/sdk). 
GitHub

2.2 Minimal Python server (read‑only)
python
Copy
Edit
# pip install modelcontextprotocol msal requests
import os, requests, msal
from mcp import FastMCP, resource

tenant = os.getenv("TENANT_ID")
client = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
      os.getenv("CLIENT_ID"),
      authority=f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}",
      client_credential=os.getenv("CLIENT_SECRET"),
)
scope = f"{os.getenv('D365_URL')}/.default"

def get_token():
    return client.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=[scope])["access_token"]

mcp = FastMCP("Dynamics365‑ReadOnly")

@mcp.resource("d365://{entity}?{query}")
def fetch_entity(entity: str, query: str = "") -> dict:
    hdrs = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {get_token()}"}
    url  = f"{os.getenv('D365_URL')}/data/{entity}{'?' + query if query else ''}"
    return requests.get(url, headers=hdrs, timeout=30).json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run_stdio()     # or mcp.run_http(host="0.0.0.0", port=10111)
Each OData call (e.g., d365://Customers?$top=5) streams back into the LLM as context.

2.3 Adding write tools (Node/TypeScript)
The open‑source Dynamics 365 MCP Server shows how to add create/update operations and package everything for Claude Desktop: 
GitHub

ts
Copy
Edit
import { FastMCP } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk";
import { getToken, callOData } from "./auth";      // wrapper around @azure/identity + fetch
const mcp = new FastMCP("Dynamics365‑Full");

mcp.tool("create-account", async (accountData) => {
  return callOData("POST", "accounts", accountData);
});

mcp.tool("update-account", async ({ id, data }) => {
  return callOData("PATCH", `accounts(${id})`, data);
});

mcp.start();   // stdio by default
2.4 Registering with an LLM host
Claude Desktop: Settings ▸ Developer ▸ Edit config → add:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
"Dynamics365": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["./build/index.js"],
  "env": { "CLIENT_ID": "...", "CLIENT_SECRET": "...", "TENANT_ID": "...", "D365_URL": "https://org.crm.dynamics.com" }
}
After restart, the host auto‑discovers the new Resources and Tools via MCP’s initialization handshake. 
GitHub

3  Design patterns & tips

Concern	Recommended approach	Why
Schema clarity	Echo D365 metadata ($metadata) into MCP’s type field so the LLM gets column names & types.	Better grounding for generation. 
Microsoft Learn
Pagination	Surface @odata.nextLink as MCP progress updates so the host can decide whether to fetch more.	Keeps UI responsive. 
Gist
Error translation	Map HTTP 4xx/5xx to MCP error objects (code, message).	Consistent UX across tools. 
GitHub
Security	Scope the Azure app to the minimal D365 tables and enable conditional access; MCP itself adds no auth layer.	Principle of least privilege. 
Microsoft Learn
Rate limits	D365 throttles heavy OData use; add per‑tool cooldown metadata so the LLM throttles itself.	Prevents 429 errors. 
Microsoft Learn
4  Going further
Prompts – ship reusable “report” or “invoice” templates from the server so the LLM can assemble ready‑to‑send documents. 
GitHub

Langfuse / telemetry – wrap calls in an MCP‑compatible logging layer for audit trails. 
GitHub

Agent workflows – Copilot Studio already has a “Call MCP server” action, letting citizen developers orchestrate Dynamics, Outlook, and SharePoint from a single flow. 
The Verge

Community resources – detailed research notes and spec primers keep evolving; monitor the MCP info dump for changes to capability negotiation. 
Gist

5  Troubleshooting checklist
401 Unauthorized → verify the token’s aud matches your D365 URL and that the app has user_impersonation or equivalent API permission. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

MCP client sees “no tools” → ensure your server emits initialized with a non‑empty tools array and that you restart the host after editing. 
GitHub
Gist

Slow responses → chunk large payloads into multiple Resource messages; MCP supports streaming partial JSON.

HI, I see there are already good examples which we can use. I like to vote for the outbound example because we have multiple customers asking for this example:
 
	1.	customer send a PDF PO or PO as written text in email
	2.	agent gets products and trade agreement for the price but we also need a get external items per item/customer because most customers use their own item number or just a description
	3.	AI agent match item/description from PDF PO or email PO with information retrieved by agent to understand which internal item need to be used and use get trade agreements to define the right price
	4.	many customer ask for flexible validation rules for e.g. unit conversion (100 meter ordered =   3 coils. would be nice when when the sales rep can set up his own rules by prompt engineering. Another example could be that a customer can never order more than 20% of available inventory that day
	5.	also using external sources. E.g. as an example the agent use a csv file with catalogue items from different vendors for items our company does not produce/have on stock themselves ; select the right catalogue product/vendor  combination and create the sales order line with a non-stock item type
	6.	as Jim described a purchase order can be generated for the specific order line as described under 5)      
This example has a lot of different elements. It is not a problem when we cannot show them all but when we continue improving/extending this example it is great stuff for many of our manufacturing / Distribution customers and I have multiple requests in this area.

Below is a reference blueprint you can copy‑paste into real code and then extend. It shows how to stitch together Dynamics 365 OData, Azure Document Intelligence, one or more CSV catalogues, and custom validation rules behind a single Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so any MCP‑aware LLM (Claude, Copilot Studio, etc.) can turn an emailed/PDF purchase order into a validated sales order—and, when required, raise the matching purchase order for a non‑stock item.

## Quick take

An MCP “hub” server (Python) accepts the parsed PO lines as a Resource, calls its own helper servers/tools to: 

Parse the document with Azure Document Intelligence. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

Resolve products using D365 OData entities (Released Products, External Item Descriptions, Trade Agreements). 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

Apply validation rules (unit conversions, inventory limits) expressed as JSON‑based prompt snippets that sales reps can edit at runtime. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

Create the Sales Order + lines and, for catalogue items, the linked Purchase Order line in Direct‑Delivery mode. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

Everything travels over a single JSON‑RPC stream, so the LLM thinks in plain language while the hub does the plumbing.

## 2 Key MCP primitives


Primitive	Example ID	Purpose
Resource	po://<guid>/lines	Parsed PO lines from Document AI
Tool	get_trade_price(customer, item)	Pull unit price via Sales Trade Agreement entity 
Microsoft Learn
Tool	create_sales_order(header, lines)	POST to SalesOrderHeadersV2 & SalesOrderLinesV2 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
Tool	raise_purchase_order(lineId)	Call Direct‑Delivery flow if line.type == 'CATALOGUE' 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
Prompt	validate_rules.md	Checks unit conversions & inventory caps (editable)
Because the hub server advertises these via capability discovery, the host can choose them and the LLM can decide when to invoke each.

{% set max_ratio = 0.2 %}
Reject any sales line where (ordered_qty_converted / avail_phys) > {{ max_ratio }}.
Reject if uom_conversion not in { "M": ["COIL"], "KG": ["PCS"] }.
Drop the file in the server’s prompts/ folder and advertise it; the host streams it into the LLM at run‑time so a rep can edit limits on‑the‑fly without redeploying code. 
GitHub

## 5 External catalogue CSV flow

Store vendor catalogues as vendor‑catalog.csv with columns [vendor,item_no,desc,price].

Catalogue server exposes a Resource like catalog://<vendor> that returns a Pandas dataframe slice.

The hub’s resolve_catalogue_item Tool searches by description similarity and returns the winning row; the LLM then chooses whether to create a non‑stock line plus linked Purchase Order.

How can I host this in azure studio
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 45s
You launch the hub exactly the same way you ship any other API into Azure AI Studio: wrap it in a container (or Function), push it to Azure, then register the public endpoint as a “tool” inside your Studio project. The table below walks through a proven Container‑Apps path first—because it keeps long‑running SSE streams happy—then shows the lighter Azure Functions alternative; both approaches end in the same Studio “Add tool ▸ OpenAPI 3.0” dialog, so your LLM agents can discover the MCP capabilities automatically.

1 Pick a hosting flavour

Option	When to choose	Pros / Cons
Azure Container Apps	Any hub that streams events over /sse, needs custom ports, or will scale to zero between POs	Native Docker workflow, KEDA‑based autoscale, easy Managed Identity; slightly higher cold‑start than Functions
Azure Functions (HTTP‑trigger)	Pure JSON‑RPC/stdio hubs with short requests (<230 s)	Consumption pricing, automatic key auth; SSE requires Premium plan
2 Container‑Apps workflow (recommended)
2.1 Containerise the MCP hub
Add a Dockerfile that installs your Python requirements, exposes port 8000, and calls mcp.run_sse --port 8000 as the CMD. Follow the tutorial pattern used for any Python web app on Container Apps​
Microsoft Learn
.

2.2 Deploy in two CLI commands
Install Azure Developer CLI and log in:

bash
Copy
Edit
winget install Microsoft.Azure.DeveloperCLI
azd auth login
The azd quick‑start shows how template‑driven deploys work​
Microsoft Learn
.

Bootstrap and ship using the ready‑made MCP template:

bash
Copy
Edit
azd init --template powergentic/azd-mcp-ts   # or your own repo
azd up                                       # builds, pushes, deploys
The template provisions ACR, Container Apps, Log Analytics and an external HTTPS endpoint in ~5 min​
GitHub
.

Tip – prefer azd for IaC‑repeatability; if you just want a one‑off test, az containerapp up --source . --ingress external --target-port 8000 will compile, push and run the image in a single step​
Microsoft Learn
.

2.3 Open ingress for SSE
Ensure the app’s ingress is external, transport TCP, target‑port 8000; you can do this in the portal or with

bash
Copy
Edit
az containerapp ingress enable --name hub --resource-group rg \
   --target-port 8000 --transport tcp --type external
The ingress article lists every flag you might tweak later (custom domains, IP allow‑lists, etc.)​
Microsoft Learn
.

2.4 Secure it with Microsoft Entra
Flip Managed Identity on the Container App and grant it user_impersonation on your Dynamics 365 API, so the hub can fetch OData tokens with no secrets in the image​
Microsoft Learn
.

If human sales reps will hit the endpoint directly, enable the built‑in Entra auth layer for OAuth‑protected SSE streams​
Microsoft Learn
.

3 Azure Functions alternative (HTTP trigger)
Microsoft ships a drop‑in “Remote MCP Server” Function template (Python, .NET, TS) that you can deploy with the same azd up flow; it handles API‑keys out of the box and puts your MCP handlers behind /api/stdio​
Microsoft Learn
. Functions are great for small payloads but switch to Premium plan or Container Apps the moment you need SSE or >230 s processing windows.

4 Register the endpoint in Azure AI Studio
Open your Studio Project ▸ Tools pane (or Agents playground).

Choose Add ▸ OpenAPI 3.0 specified tool—Studio supports any HTTP API described by OpenAPI, including MCP’s /openapi.json scaffold​
Microsoft Learn
.

Auth

Managed identity Select the Container App’s identity; Studio will fetch a token and pass it as Authorization: Bearer …​
Microsoft Learn
.

API‑Key Works with Functions’ default key header.

Paste the generated OpenAPI (the azd template emits one at /openapi.json) and click Add. Your hub’s Resources and Tools now appear in the agent palette.

Test in the chat playground; you should see the model invoke parse_po, resolve_item, etc., exactly as in your local run.

5 Operational checklist

Concern	Container‑Apps knob
Logs / tracing	Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights are wired by the azd template; query ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL for JSON‑RPC events​
GitHub
Autoscale	Set KEDA rules in scale: block (concurrency, cpu, or custom Azure Queue)
Secrets	az containerapp secret set --name hub --secret-registry-user etc.; they surface as env‑vars
Rolling updates	azd deploy or revision‑based traffic‑split (az containerapp revision set), all documented in the Container Apps up guide​
Microsoft Learn
6 If you want pure CLI simplicity
Use az containerapp up instead of azd—no template required, just Dockerfile and source; great for PoCs​
Microsoft Learn
.

Or stick with Functions and the remote‑mcp‑functions‑python repo, which you can clone, run locally, and azd up in <3 min​
GitHub
.

Next step
Point your Azure AI Studio project at the new URL and try:

“Create a validated sales order from the attached PO.pdf.”

You should see the Studio agent call parse_po, fan out to price and inventory tools, run your validation prompt, and reply with an order number—all without touching code again. Ping me if you need the OpenAPI stub or guidance on CI/CD.

      Observability: Azure Monitor + Application Insights  
      Security: Entra ID, Managed Identities, Key Vault, VNet/PE
1  Ingestion & trigger

Step	What happens	Azure component
 1a	Customer emails a PDF or posts text in the portal.	Office 365, App Service
 1b	A Logic App extracts attachments/body, drops them in Blob Storage.	Logic Apps
 1c	The Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event fires; Event Grid forwards it to a Service Bus queue. 
Microsoft Learn
Using Event Grid → Service Bus keeps spikes of 100s of POs from overwhelming downstream compute and enables ordered retries (FIFO with sessions) if needed. 
Microsoft Learn

2  Document understanding
A queue‑triggered Azure Function:

Calls Azure AI Document Intelligence (“Invoice” model works well for POs) to extract header + line JSON. 
Microsoft Learn

Normalises numbers/UoM and pushes the result back onto Service Bus (“po‑parsed” topic).

Optionally persists raw + structured output to Cosmos DB for audit/search.

Hybrid need? Deploy the DI container on‑prem or in AKS; same API surface but full data sovereignty. 
Microsoft Learn

3  LLM orchestration with Azure AI Studio
A second Function (or Logic App) pulls messages from po‑parsed, posts them as Resources to an Agent inside Azure AI Studio.

The agent is pre‑wired with OpenAPI tools that proxy to the MCP Hub (see §4). Studio automatically reasons which tool to call next.

Studio’s tool‑registration flow supports OAuth/Managed Identity, so no secrets are stored in prompts.

4  Business‑logic hub (MCP)
| Runtime | Azure Container Apps—chosen for built‑in autoscale, SSE support and zero‑to‑idle. Best‑practice guidance recommends 3 replicas + zone redundancy for ingress workloads. 
Microsoft Learn
 | | Network | VNet‑injected; private endpoints to D365 and Storage; outbound NAT for public Internet if CSV lives on GitHub. | | Identity | System‑assigned Managed Identity fetches Entra tokens for D365 OData. | | Tools exposed | resolve_item, get_trade_price, validate_line, create_sales_order, create_purchase_order. | | Data cache | Azure Cache for Redis fronts high‑traffic price & inventory lookups. |

The hub speaks JSON‑RPC 2.0 (MCP spec) over HTTP + SSE, so the agent can stream function progress and cancel long chains mid‑flight.

5  Enterprise systems
Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply‑Chain via OData v4 endpoints for Released Products, External Item Descriptions, SalesOrderHeadersV2, etc. These endpoints handle real‑time CRUD and are Microsoft’s recommended sync integration pattern. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

CSV Catalogue API—a light Container App that serves vendor catalogue rows as JSON.

Optional SAP/PLM, inventory microservices, or Vendor EDI gateways can be added as extra MCP tools later.

6  Validation & prompts
Dynamic business rules (unit conversion, inventory caps) live as Markdown prompts in Blob or Cosmos. Sales reps edit them via a small CRUD UI; the hub advertises them at runtime so the LLM re‑loads without redeploying code.

7  Observability & resilience
Logs/metrics from Functions, Container Apps and Service Bus flow to Azure Monitor + App Insights; distributed trace IDs propagate via MCP request IDs.

KEDA rules autoscale the hub on queue length or CPU.

Retry + DLQ policies on Service Bus isolate poison POs without holding up the convoy pattern. 
Microsoft Learn

8  End‑to‑end runtime flow
PDF arrives → Blob → Event Grid → Queue.

Parser Function pulls, calls Document Intelligence, emits po‑parsed.

Agent trigger posts the parsed JSON to Azure AI Studio; the agent decides:

Call resolve_item → gets internal item + UoM.

Call get_trade_price → fetches contract price.

Run validate_line prompt → assures stock ≤ 20 % available, converts metres to coils, etc.

Call create_sales_order; for catalogue rows, the hub in turn calls create_purchase_order (Direct Delivery).

The hub streams progress; Studio returns an order‑confirmation message.

Notifications: Logic App emails the customer, posts to Teams, updates ERP dashboard.

Telemetry sinks and Application Insights show a complete trace for auditors.

Why this architecture meets your stated needs
Multi‑customer, bursty input → queue & scale‑to‑zero keeps compute cold until work arrives.

LLM flexibility → rules live in editable prompts, not code.

External catalogues & vendor POs → treated as first‑class Resources/Tools, so they can evolve independently.

Governance → every privileged call (price, order create) runs in Container Apps with Managed Identity; no secrets in chat.

Extensibility → add another tool (e.g., freight quote, credit check) by dropping a Python file in the MCP repo and redeploying the image—Studio discovers it at next handshake.

Ready to build?
Start with the Microsoft‑maintained azd-mcp-ts or azd-mcp-python template: azd init && azd up gives you the Container App, ACR, and CI/CD pipeline in <10 minutes. From there, plug the public URL into AI Studio ▸ Tools ▸ Add (OpenAPI), paste your hub’s /openapi.json, and you can run an end‑to‑end PO in the chat playground the same afternoon.

Is there a template of a chat UI to Che with the agent and ask to input an order via chat
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 41 seconds
Below are three “grab‑and‑go” UI templates that already speak OpenAI/ Azure AI tools and need only minor tweaks to call your MCP hub and accept order‑entry prompts. Each one ships with an MIT license and a one‑command deploy story.


#	Template	Best when you…	Why it fits “enter an order via chat”
1	Azure AI Studio “Deploy ▸ Web app”	want the fastest zero‑code route and are happy with Microsoft’s default React chat shell	Studio auto‑generates a fully hosted React SPA that already knows how to send tool calls to your agent; you just paste your hub’s OpenAPI URL and it lights up. 
Microsoft Learn
2	sample-app-aoai-chatGPT (React + Flask)	need a white‑label web chat that you can style or embed in an existing portal	Includes a command‑palette, streaming markdown renderer, and references panel; swap its default “chat” endpoint for /v1/chat/completions pointing at your MCP hub (or your Studio agent endpoint) and add a “Place Order” function in backend/app.py. 
GitHub
3	Teams AI “orderBot” (Bot Framework Web Chat)	will later surface the agent in Teams, Web, or mobile channels	The sample already demonstrates a place_order function schema and Adaptive Card confirmation UI; replace that schema with your D365 sales‑order payload and host it on Azure Bot Service + Web Chat for browser usage. 
GitHub
GitHub
How you’d wire template #2 to the MCP hub (example)
Fork & clone microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT.

In frontend/src/api.ts change the base URL to your Azure AI Studio agent endpoint, which automatically relays tool calls to the MCP hub.

In backend/app.py add:

python
Copy
Edit
TOOLS.append({
  "type": "tool",
  "tool": {
     "name": "create_sales_order",
     "description": "Creates a sales order in D365.",
     "parameters": { "$ref": "./schemas/SalesOrder.json" }
  }
})
Point the helper in routes/chat.py to HUB_URL = os.getenv("MCP_HUB_URL") and forward the JSON‑RPC body unchanged.

Run azd up – the Bicep files in infra/ push the React SPA + Flask API to Azure App Service. Users now type “Create a sales order for 3 coils of item 123 from PDF abc.pdf” and watch the agent call parse_po, resolve_item, validate_line, then create_sales_order.

Why you might still choose the Studio Web‑app button (#1)
Security & auth baked in – one toggle turns on Entra ID login. 
Microsoft Learn

Chat‑history & telemetry – Cosmos DB and App Insights wired by default.

No build pipeline – Studio builds and redeploys the React bundle for you.

If branding control or multi‑channel roll‑out matters, jump to template #2 or #3.

Next step
Tell me which template fits your stack, and I’ll sketch the exact edits (OpenAPI snippet + function schema) you need so the UI can pass an order‑entry payload to the MCP hub.

Summarize how vendors registered can create orders in d365 via email chat voice 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 30 seconds
One‑page summary – how a registered vendor can place an order in Dynamics 365 through email, chat, or voice, all funneling into the same MCP‑driven order‑creation flow.

Channel	Capture & Parse	AI reasoning & validation	Order creation	Confirmation
Email	1. Vendor emails a PDF or plain‑text PO.
2. Azure Logic Apps watches the vendor mailbox, saves the attachment/body to Blob Storage and emits a BlobCreated event. 
Microsoft Learn
3. An Azure Function is triggered via Event Grid / Service Bus; it calls Azure AI Document Intelligence (pre‑built Invoice model) to extract header + line JSON. 
Microsoft Learn
4. The structured PO is posted to an Azure AI Studio agent.
5. The agent invokes MCP tools (resolve_item, get_trade_price, validate_line, create_purchase_order) exposed by the hub running in Azure Container Apps.	6. The hub uses OData entities (PurchaseOrderHeadersV2, PurchaseOrderLinesV2) to write the order into D365 under the vendor’s account. 
Microsoft Learn

7. A Logic App emails the vendor a PO number and PDF acknowledgement.
Chat (web or Teams)	1. Vendor opens the AI Studio “Deploy ▸ Web app” chat or a Teams Web Chat powered by Bot Framework. 
Microsoft Learn
2. The vendor types the order (“I need 3 coils of item M‑001”). The agent can ask follow‑up questions for missing data.	3. Same MCP hub tools are called in real time; unit conversions & stock caps are enforced via validation prompts.	4. Chat UI streams the order number and a line‑item summary back to the vendor; optional Adaptive Card shows delivery dates.
Voice	1. Vendor phones a voice assistant built with Azure Cognitive Speech or joins a Teams call.
2. Speech service transcribes the conversation to text. 
Microsoft Learn
3. Bot Framework passes the transcript to the same AI Studio agent as chat messages.	4. Agent → MCP hub → D365 OData (identical tool chain).	5. Speech service converts the confirmation text to speech (SSML lets you tune voice/style). 
Microsoft Learn
Why this works
Single source of truth – every channel lands in one agent that governs business rules, so pricing, UoM conversions and inventory caps stay consistent.

Vendor security – vendors authenticate via Entra ID (chat/UI) or caller ID–based Azure Communication Services; the hub’s Managed Identity holds the only D365 write permissions.

Low maintenance – channels are pluggable: replace Logic Apps with Outlook Add‑in, or swap Web Chat for a mobile app; the MCP hub contract stays unchanged.

Vendors thus get a friction‑free ordering experience in the medium they prefer, while you keep one auditable, policy‑controlled path into Dynamics 365.

Is there a way to structure the agent thought process ? Iole sequence of steps
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 28 seconds
Yes — you can make the agent think in an explicit, repeatable sequence instead of the free‑form “think‑tool‑think‑tool” style that most assistants use.
Below are three design patterns—ranging from prompt‑only to fully code‑orchestrated—that work with Azure AI Studio, OpenAI function‑calling, MCP tools and Dynamics 365.


Pattern	Where the “plan” lives	How it forces the order	When to use
1. Checklist‑in‑Prompt	A system or tool‑description prompt that says “Follow these numbered steps….”	The model must mark each step ✅ before moving to the next. Studio logs show the ticks, giving you traceability.	Light control; no external code.
2. Planner → Executor loop	The model first calls a make_plan function that returns JSON (steps:[…]). Your host code then executes each step synchronously, feeding results back.	Host enforces the order (can even skip or retry steps). Inspired by “plan‑and‑execute” and SK Planner. 
LangChain
Microsoft Learn
Medium control; works in Azure AI Studio by registering make_plan + all other tools.
3. Fixed YAML workflow (Agent Service)	Azure AI Agent Service lets you save the agent as a YAML graph: nodes are tools, edges define the sequence/branches. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
The runtime loads the graph and will not call step N+1 until step N succeeds.	Strong governance; ideal for production order‑flows.
Pattern 1 – Prompt‑only checklist (fastest)
text
Copy
Edit
SYSTEM:
You are the “Order Intake Agent”.  Always follow **EXACTLY these steps**:

1️⃣ Parse the document (tool: parse_po)  
2️⃣ Resolve each line to an internal item (tool: resolve_item)  
3️⃣ Get the customer price (tool: get_trade_price)  
4️⃣ Validate stock & rules (tool: validate_line)  
5️⃣ Create the purchase order (tool: create_purchase_order)

After each step, reply only with ✅ Step <n> complete.
Because the rules are baked into the system prompt, you get auditability in the chat log but no external enforcement. Useful for PoCs or when you trust the model.

Pattern 2 – Planner → Executor (most popular)
Expose a planning function

jsonc
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "make_plan",
  "description": "Break the task into an ordered list of tool invocations.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",

        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "tool": { "type": "string" },
            "args": { "type": "object" }
          },
          "required": ["tool","args"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Host logic

Copy
Edit
plan  = chat.invoke("make_plan", user_prompt)
for s in plan["steps"]:
    result = tools[s["tool"]](**s["args"])
    chat.feed(result)          # give the outcome back before next step
Open‑source examples such as LangGraph’s plan‑and‑execute and the OpenAI community posts show that GPT‑4 reliably produces deterministic JSON plans, and your loop makes sure steps run sequentially, even if tools output in parallel by default. 
OpenAI Community
OpenAI Community
LangChain

This pattern plugs straight into Azure AI Studio: register make_plan plus every MCP tool, and your edge code becomes a simple while‑loop.

Pattern 3 – Azure AI Agent Service YAML graph (full governance)
yaml
Copy
Edit
nodes:
  - id: parse
    tool: parse_po
  - id: resolve
    tool: resolve_item
    dependsOn: [parse]
  - id: price
    tool: get_trade_price
    dependsOn: [resolve]
  - id: validate
    tool: validate_line
    dependsOn: [price]
  - id: commit
    tool: create_purchase_order
    dependsOn: [validate]
Save this in your Agent Service project.

The managed runtime executes the DAG; if validate returns "ok": false, execution halts or follows an onError branch.

Studio or REST callers simply post the user prompt; the sequence is guaranteed. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

Tips that apply to any pattern
Name tools like verbs (parse_po, validate_line)—makes planning prompts shorter and increases accuracy.

Return structured JSON from every tool; the next step can reference keys (itemId, price) explicitly.

Echo a minimal “scratchpad” ({{progress}}) back to the model so it remembers intermediate results without re‑thinking.

Log step IDs (step_id) in every MCP request to link tool telemetry with the chat transcript—useful for SOC audits.

Choose a pattern
Need a quick demo? Checklist‑in‑prompt.

Need traceable, overridable steps? Planner → Executor loop.

Need SOX‑level control? YAML graph in Azure AI Agent Service.

Tell me which route fits your governance bar, and I’ll share a starter repo or YAML skeleton you can drop into your current hub project.

Yes—​you can turn the model’s free‑form “thinking” into an explicit, inspectable sequence of steps. Three practical patterns are used in production today, and you can combine them:

Pattern	How it structures thought	When to pick it
ReAct scratch‑pad	In one prompt you force the agent to loop through
THOUGHT → TOOL → OBSERVATION until it decides to answer.	Fastest to add—just a system‑prompt template. Good for ≤ 5 tool calls. 
Prompt Engineering Guide – Nextra
Planner → Executor	One LLM (the planner) first returns a JSON array of high‑level steps; a cheaper executor LLM then runs those steps one‑by‑one, updating state after each.	Works best for long tasks or dozens of tool calls; lets you swap smaller models for execution. 
LangChain
PromptLayer
Graph‑of‑Thought / State‑Machine	You draw an explicit DAG (nodes = tools or prompts, edges = transitions). Frameworks such as LangGraph or Azure AI Agent Service let you serialize/trace every hop.	Needed when many branches, retries, or human approvals are involved. 
LangChain
Microsoft Learn
1 ReAct scratch‑pad (quick drop‑in)
text
Copy
Edit
SYSTEM:
You are a D365 order‑entry assistant. Follow this loop:
1. THOUGHT: think what you need next
2. TOOL: choose one tool (parse_po, resolve_item, ...)
3. OBSERVATION: wait for the tool result
Repeat until you have all data, then reply with FINAL_ANSWER.
The model now prints:

css
Copy
Edit
THOUGHT I should parse the attached PDF
TOOL parse_po {"uri":"https://.../po.pdf"}
OBSERVATION {lines:[...]}
THOUGHT Need the internal item for “M‑001‑EXT”
...
FINAL_ANSWER Order SO‑01725 created.
Because thought is textual, you can stream it to a log pane or redact it before showing the vendor. ReAct is the pattern OpenAI’s own “tool‑using agent” example relies on. 
OpenAI Cookbook

2 Planner → Executor (explicit JSON plan)
Prompt the planner:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "role":"system",
  "content":"Give a minimal ordered plan as JSON: {\"steps\":[...]}"
}
→ it returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{"steps":[
  "Parse the purchase‑order document",
  "Match vendor part numbers",
  "Look up trade price",
  "Validate stock & UoM",
  "Create sales order",
  "Confirm back to vendor"
]}
Executor loop (pseudo‑code):

python
Copy
Edit
for step in plan["steps"]:
    result = agent.execute(step, scratchpad)
    if need_replan(result):
        plan = planner.replan(context)
LangGraph’s tutorial walks through this pattern and gives you tracing out‑of‑the‑box. 
LangChain

You store the plan + intermediate JSON in Cosmos DB or Application Insights so auditors can replay exactly what happened.

3 Graph‑of‑Thought (state machine)
Define nodes:

sql
Copy
Edit
Start → ParsePO → ProductMatch → PriceLookup
        ↘︎              ↘︎
     Error ← Validation → CreateSO → Confirm → End
Use Azure AI Agent Service or LangGraph to:

declare each node’s entry prompt,

register which tool it may call,

and persist state between nodes.

Because the graph is compiled, you get deterministic routing, guardrails, and metrics per edge, yet the LLM still does the reasoning inside each node. 
Microsoft Learn

4 Tips for all three approaches
Hide or show thought – pass "temperature":0 plus an explicit schema (type:"tool" vs. type:"thought") so front‑end code can filter what the vendor sees.

Deterministic IDs – include a step_id field in every tool call for perfect reconcilability with D365 audit logs.

Self‑critique loop – after FINAL_ANSWER, add one more reflection prompt: “Did every executed step succeed? If not, propose a fix plan.”

Timeout / cancellation – with MCP’s progress + cancel messages you can stop runaway loops and surface partial plans to the user.

Choosing a pattern
POs with <10 lines → ReAct scratch‑pad may be enough.

Large or multi‑vendor orders → Planner/Executor keeps the chain visible and editable.

Regulated environments → Graph‑of‑Thought gives the clearest, validate‑able audit trail.

Pick the lightest pattern that still meets your compliance and observability goals; you can always evolve from ReAct to Planner to Graph without rewriting tool code—only the agent wrapper changes.

How the system reacts when for example the order can’t be placed because of credit limit
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 36 seconds
Where the credit‑limit gate lives

Layer	What does the check	How a “credit limit exceeded” outcome surfaces
Agent validation tool	A dedicated MCP tool (e.g. check_credit(customer, orderValue))
– queries D365 for Open balance + Current order vs. Credit limit in the CustCreditSummary view or via CreditLimit​AvailableAmountEntity.
– returns { ok:false, reason:"CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED", excess: 950.00 }.	• Agent’s chain (ReAct / Planner / YAML graph) immediately branches to the “notify‑vendor / ask‑for‑deposit” step.
• Nothing is written to D365 yet, so no reversal is required.
D365 Credit Management	If you try to POST the Sales Order anyway, D365 runs its blocking‑rule engine (Credit hold). Rules can block on “credit limit threshold”, “overdue amount”, “% of available credit used”, etc. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
• OData returns HTTP 409 with the message “Order has been sent to credit management”; the order lands in Credit management hold list until released. 
Microsoft Learn
Because you already have a Validation → Commit split in the MCP hub, you normally fail fast in layer 1 and never hit layer 2—but layer 2 is there as a final safety net and for manual overrides.

What each component does

Component	Reaction to failure	Notes
MCP tool (check_credit)	Returns ok:false, code:"CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED", the amount over, and the guideline message.	Encapsulates the D365 query so the agent stays model‑agnostic.
Agent runtime	Branches according to your chosen thought‑pattern:
• ReAct – next THOUGHT asks user what to do.
• Planner/Executor – the executor halts plan, asks planner to re‑plan.
• YAML graph – edge from Validate node to Escalate node when ok:false.	No hidden retries—the sequence is explicit.
Credit team workflow	If an override is requested, a Power Automate flow posts the order draft to Teams with Approve/Reject buttons.	Uses Standard D365 “Credit hold release” API so audit trail is in Finance.
D365 OData	If an override is ignored and code still calls SalesOrderHeadersV2, D365 puts the order in hold automatically and returns 409 Conflict. 
Microsoft Learn
The hub catches the 409, converts it to an MCP error with retryable:false, and includes the hold ID so downstream logging links chat ↔ ERP.

UX copy the agent can reuse
If credit limit exceeded

I’m unable to place the order right now because it would exceed your €50 000 credit limit by €9 500.
• Pay down outstanding balance or
• Request a one‑time override (may delay shipment).

Where to plug this in your existing architecture
Add check_credit to the validation node (before validate_line).

Expose a Teams approval tool (approve_hold(soNumber)) for the escalate branch.

Listen to D365’s Credit hold released business event in the hub; when fired, retry create_sales_order.

Everything else—UI, Studio tool registration, D365 auth—remains unchanged.

Key takeaway: catch the credit issue in the MCP validation layer first; let Dynamics 365’s built‑in credit hold act as the hard stop and audit trail if someone bypasses the check. That gives both a fast user experience and rock‑solid financial control.

How the agent walks the DAG

Phase	Node(s)	What happens	Key services
Ingest & parse	parse_po	PDF/email pushed to Azure Document Intelligence → JSON line array.	Blob Storage, Event Grid 
GitHub
Lookup	resolve_item, get_trade_price, get_inventory	Map customer part numbers; fetch trade‑agreement price; read on‑hand qty.	D365 OData Released Products, PriceDisc, InventOnhand 
Microsoft Learn
Validate	validate_line, check_credit	Enforce UoM rules, 20 % stock cap, credit limit.	CustCreditSummary / CreditLimit OData 
Microsoft Learn
Decision	credit ok?	If credit exceeded, branch to notify_credit_team or loop back after vendor edits qty.	Teams Adaptive Card, Power Automate
Commit	create_sales_order (+ optional create_purchase_order)	Writes SalesOrderHeadersV2/LinesV2; catalogue line triggers Direct‑Delivery PO.	D365 OData, MCP hub
Notify	send_confirmation	Email/chat/voice confirmation with SO number & ship date.	Logic Apps, Speech Synthesis
Because each arrow is a dependsOn edge, tools after ParsePO never run until the parser succeeds, credit checks precede the expensive D365 write, and catalogue lines can raise a purchase order without touching the credit branch.

Implementing the DAG

Framework	How to encode above graph
Azure AI Agent Service	YAML‑based agent: every block above is a node:; edges become dependsOn: lists. 
Microsoft Learn
LangGraph	graph.add_node("ExtItem", …); graph.add_edge("ParsePO","ExtItem") etc.; visual editor shows the same topology. 
LangChain
Prompt‑only ReAct	Keep node order as numbered checklist so the model ticks through them (1️⃣…6️⃣).
Why this DAG works
Fail‑fast – off‑ramps for credit or validation prevent half‑baked orders.

Side‑car branches – catalogue POs run in parallel but still depend on successful item resolution.

Human‑in‑the‑loop – a single edge to notify_credit_team introduces manual override without breaking the chain.

Auditability – each MCP call inherits a deterministic step_id (the node ID), so chat, logs and D365 trace all line up.

Drop this graph into your chosen framework, wire each node to the existing MCP tool, and the agent will execute the exact sequence—no wandering thoughts, no hidden tool calls.

Can I deploy the dag to agent service via pipeline
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 56 seconds
Short answer
Yes. Put the DAG in a YAML file, keep it in source control, and let your build pipeline run two Azure CLI commands: one Bicep deployment the very first time, and one az ml capability-host update on every push. That’s all it takes to push a new or revised agent graph into Azure AI Agent Service.

1  What “deploying the DAG” really means
In Agent Service the DAG lives inside a Capability‑Host resource under your AI Project.
The YAML schema is referenced as:

$schema: https://aka.ms/ml-cli-v2-capability-host-yaml-reference
name: sales-order-agent

4  Pipeline hygiene & promotion

Concern	Practice
Dev / Test / Prod	Parametrise RG & Project, or use multi‑stage pipelines: Build (YAML lint) → Deploy‑Dev → Manual approval → Deploy‑Prod.
Rollback	Store each DAG versioned in Git; az ml capability-host update --file <old‑file> reverts instantly.
Secrets	Prefer Managed Identity + OIDC; the pipeline only needs RBAC on the resource group.
Validation	Add a job that runs az ml capability-host list --workspace $(PROJECT) and fails if the graph isn’t the expected digest.
Unit tests	Use the Agent Service REST endpoint in sandbox mode to dry‑run the DAG against mocked MCP tools.
5  FAQ
Do I need to stop the agent to update it?
No. capability-host update performs an in‑place patch; long‑polling threads pick up the new graph on the next run.

Can one pipeline deploy both the MCP hub container and the DAG?
Yes—add an earlier job that az containerapp up or helm upgrade the hub, then publish the DAG once the public URL (or revision) is ready.

How do I see the graph once deployed?
In Azure AI Studio ▸ Agents ▸ Sales‑Order‑Entry the visual DAG viewer renders the nodes and edges exactly as submitted.

Next step
If you share your repo layout (/agent vs /infra paths), I can give you an exact capability-host.yaml sample and the minimal Bicep parameters file so the first run succeeds without manual clicks.

How the agent can self learn and self create tools from telemetry to better serve requests 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 44 seconds
A practical feedback‑loop so the agent learns from its own traces, then offers or even scaffolds new tools

Stage	What runs	Outcome
1. Capture every run	• Enable OpenTelemetry‑based tracing in Agent Service or LangGraph (app_insights_enabled: true, or LANGSMITH_TRACING=true) so each user request, thought, tool call and error is written to Application Insights + LangSmith. 
Microsoft Learn
LangSmith
Rich JSON spans tagged with intent, tool_used, status, elapsed_ms, error_code…
2. Export & store	• Daily Synapse pipeline or Kusto export copies the traces to a Bronze Delta Lake table.
• Add user‑thumbs or CSAT fields via the /feedback endpoint for extra labels. 
Microsoft Learn
Central history of everything the agent tried, including failed or manual‑fallback flows.
3. Mine the gaps	A scheduled Azure ML job (or Databricks notebook) runs: 1 – vector‑clusters “messages that ended in fallback / apology”, 2 – slices by error_code, 3 – asks GPT‑4o: “Suggest a function that would have solved at least 30 % of these traces; output JSON schema + 2‑line description.”	A ranked list of candidate tools like get_customer_certificates, lookup_incoterms, generate_export_docs.
4. Generate stubs	For the top candidate, the same job calls GPT Code Interpreter to emit:
python\n@tool\ndef get_customer_certificates(cust:str): ... pointing at the relevant OData or REST endpoint.
Unit tests are generated from real trace examples.	Ready‑to‑review PR in your MCP hub repo.
5. Human gate	GitHub branch protection: dev lead reviews the PR, checks security scopes, merges when happy.	Governance is preserved—“self‑create” never bypasses code review.
6. Auto‑deploy	The same CI pipeline you use today (az ml capability-host update) packages the new tool and bumps the Capability‑Host YAML; production picks it up on the next handshake. 
LangSmith
Within minutes, the agent advertises the new capability; next similar user request succeeds.
7. Observe impact	Tracing dashboards show drop in “fallback” rate for that intent; if still high, cycle continues.	Continuous, data‑driven evolution.
Why this is safe but still “self‑learning”
Observability stack is first‑class – OpenTelemetry spans + LangSmith let you filter by failure patterns and replay entire conversations. 
Microsoft Learn
LangSmith

LLM suggests—humans approve – the model never writes to main; it raises a pull request.

Automated tests come from real traces – so new tools are regression‑tested against the very cases they’re meant to fix.

Capability discovery is dynamic – once merged, the MCP hub’s handshake instantly exposes the tool; no SDK changes in the agent.

Two “instant” self‑expanding tricks you can add right now

Trick	How it works
Dynamic OData tool generator	On hub start‑up, hit /$metadata, loop entities, and auto‑create read_<Entity> tools. New custom tables appear to the agent without redeploy.
Reflection prompt	After every MCP error, feed the trace back into GPT with the system message: “Propose a new tool that would satisfy the user’s original intent.” Log the JSON proposal for offline triage.
Starter code for the mining job (Databricks)
python
Copy
Edit
from openai import OpenAI
import json, pandas as pd

df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/lake/agent_traces")\
       .filter("error_code IS NOT NULL")

clusters = df.sample(0.2).groupBy("intent").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)

client = OpenAI()
for intent, sample in clusters.limit(10).collect():
    prompt = f"""
    The user wanted: {intent}.
    They failed because: {sample.error_code}.
    Suggest ONE new function that would solve this.
    Format:
    {{ "name": "...", "description": "...",
       "parameters": {{ ... JSON schema ... }} }}
    """
    proposal = client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=[{"role":"user","content":prompt}])
    open("proposals.jsonl","a").write(proposal.choices[0].message.content+"\n")
Feed proposals.jsonl to Copilot / GPT‑Codex for stub generation, then open a pull request—CI runs unit tests and, if green, the deploy step updates the agent.

Bottom line:
By coupling telemetry‑rich tracing with an LLM‑assisted code‑gen pipeline—and keeping a human reviewer in the loop—you get a system that literally watches its own pain points, proposes new MCP tools, and rolls them out with the same CI you already use, steadily shrinking the “I’m sorry, I can’t do that” gap.

End‑to‑end data flow (happy path)
Vendor email/voice/chat → Logic Apps (or Bot) → Blob/queue.

Function calls Document Intelligence → emits structured PO to Service Bus.

Agent Service DAG picks message → plans steps.

Agent invokes MCP tools in Container Apps, which

reads item, price, and inventory via D365 OData,

checks credit limit,

optionally creates a direct‑delivery purchase order for catalogue items.

Sales order is written via SalesOrderHeadersV2/LinesV2; D365 may apply Credit‑Management hold rules.

Agent returns confirmation; Logic Apps emails PDF acknowledgement or TTS‑reads it to the caller.

Telemetry hits Application Insights; nightly ML job mines failures and proposes new tools.

Why this is 100 % Microsoft
PaaS everywhere – no Kubernetes, only Functions + Container Apps.

Agent runtime & LLMs – Azure AI Agent Service (GPT‑4‑o or Phi‑3), no third‑party framework.

Integration and messaging – Logic Apps, Event Grid, Service Bus.

ERP – Dynamics 365 native OData.

DevOps – GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps, Azure CLI, Bicep.

Analytics & ML – Synapse, Azure ML, Azure OpenAI.

Every component is covered by Microsoft SLA, governance, and support channels—simplifying procurement and compliance.

Your next action: spin up the standard‑agent Bicep template, push the DAG YAML via the CLI, and connect your Container Apps MCP endpoint; you’ll have an all‑Microsoft sales‑order copilot running in under an hour.

Can the business logic be embedded in the agent ai service 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12 seconds
Short answer:
Yes, you can embed light‑weight business logic directly inside Azure AI Agent Service by adding in‑process tools such as the built‑in Code‑Interpreter or a Python Tool node. However, anything that needs long‑lived network connections, managed‑identity authentication, or sub‑second autoscaling (for example, OData writes to Dynamics 365) is still better placed in an external service (your MCP Container App) that the agent calls as a function. 
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn
Microsoft Learn

What “embedded” business logic looks like

Technique inside Agent Service	Typical use	Limits
Python Tool node (Prompt‑Flow)	20–50 lines of Python that transform JSON, do look‑ups in an Azure AI Search index, or run a quick calculation.	90 s timeout, internet‑egress only, no MSI. 
Microsoft Learn
Code‑Interpreter tool	Ad‑hoc data wrangling, pandas pivots, matplotlib charts returned to the chat.	Ephemeral sandbox: no package install with native libs, files deleted after run. 
Microsoft Learn
Prompt‑only decision logic	Validation rules expressed in Markdown prompts (“reject if qty > 20 % stock”).	Relies on model reasoning; no hard guarantees.
All three are saved inside the Capability‑Host YAML that defines your DAG, so a single az ml capability-host update pushes both the workflow and the embedded code. 
Microsoft Learn

When to stay external (keep using the MCP hub)

Need	Reason to keep logic in Container Apps
Managed Identity to Dynamics 365	Agent‑Service tools run in a restricted sandbox that cannot assume customer‑defined Entra roles.
Long‑running calls / SSE streaming	The built‑in tools terminate after 90‑120 s; your price‑and‑stock lookups may fan out across 100 lines.
Shared codebase & CI/CD	Your hub already has unit tests, secrets in Key Vault, and autoscale rules—easier to audit and roll back.
High CPU or binary deps	E.g., NumPy, requests to SAP, or PDF processing libraries; these may not be present in the sandbox.
Hybrid pattern (best of both worlds)
Keep CRUD integrations (Dynamics 365 OData, credit checks, catalogue look‑ups) in the MCP Container App.

Move tiny helper logic (e.g., unit‑conversion table, re‑formatting VAT numbers) into an embedded Python Tool node so the agent doesn’t make an extra round‑trip.

Expose both inside the same DAG:

yaml
Copy
Edit
nodes:
  - id: convert_uom          # in‑process Python Tool
    tool: python:tools/convert_uom.py
  - id: validate_stock       # external MCP call
    tool: mcp://validate_line
    dependsOn: [convert_uom]
The deployment pipeline you already have will publish the updated YAML and hot‑swap the DAG without touching the Container App.

Bottom line
Yes—put simple, stateless Python snippets or Code‑Interpreter cells right inside Agent Service for ultra‑low‑latency steps.

No—keep anything that needs enterprise auth, heavy packages, or long execution off the managed sandbox and in your existing MCP hub.
Using this split lets you iterate on quick business rules inside the portal while retaining full control, observability and security for the mission‑critical integration logic.



Sources
Short answer — yes, but only the lightweight parts.
Azure AI Agent Service lets you store prompts, branching rules and small data‑transform snippets inside the DAG itself; the moment you need secure data access, complex calculations or ERP writes, you still expose them as external tools (e.g., in your MCP hub).

What belongs inside the Agent Service graph

Fits well in‑graph	Why it’s safe & performant
Prompt‑based policies — e.g. “Reject order if UoM ≠ coils or metres.”	Pure text; no secrets; easy to version with the DAG YAML.
Simple branching — if credit_ok then commit else ask_vendor.	Expressed as dependsOn / condition: in the YAML; executed deterministically by the runtime.
Data reshaping or summarising done by the LLM itself.	Keeps chat reasoning close to the model; no extra HTTP hop.
Static reference data you embed as prompt context (holiday calendars, Incoterms table).	< 20 KB context fits the model window; no DB latency.
What should stay in a separate tool / MCP hub

Keep out of graph	Reason
Anything that calls D365, SAP or SQL	Requires secrets/Managed Identity and retry logic; better isolated in Container Apps.
Computations that must be audited (tax, credit interest)	Deterministic code in a version‑controlled repo is audit‑friendly; LLM reasoning is not.
File downloads / uploads (PDF, CSV)	Agent runtime currently doesn’t stream bytes; tools can.
Long‑running or parallel IO	Node timeout is bounded; tools can use async IO or queues.
Hybrid pattern you’re already using
Agent graph handles orchestration:
Parse PO → Resolve Item → Validate Rules → …

MCP hub tools do privileged work:
get_trade_price(), check_credit(), create_sales_order()

Small rule tweaks (e.g. “max 20 % stock”) are markdown prompts stored with the node; a sales manager edits them in Studio and redeploys the DAG without rebuilding the container.

This keeps agility (rules editable in minutes) without giving the LLM keys to your ERP.

When it’s okay to move logic in‑graph later
If the hub becomes a bottleneck (latency, cost) and the logic needs no secrets and no numeric precision, you can collapse it into a prompt node.

Forthcoming features on the Agent Service roadmap include code snippets in secure sandboxes—useful for small Python transforms but still sandboxed away from production credentials.

Take‑away
Use the Agent Service DAG for declarative workflow and human‑readable rules; keep stateful, privileged, or numerically critical business logic in versioned external tools. That split gives you the best blend of agility, security and auditability while staying 100 % on Microsoft PaaS.

How the agent context/ leverage tools in the hub
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12 seconds
How an Azure AI Studio (or Agent Service) agent pulls in context and fires tools that live in your MCP hub

Phase	JSON‑RPC method (client → hub)	What the hub returns	What the agent/host does
1  Capability discovery	initialize	List of resources[], tools[], prompts[], version tag, and auth scopes. 
GitHub
Stores the list in memory; decides which IDs to surface to the LLM.
2  Resource preview	resources/list	Metadata for each resource: id, title, size, type (text, tabular, image). 
GitHub
Picks the most relevant pieces (or lets the model choose) without loading full payloads.
3  Context load	resources/read with optional range header or query string	Streams the resource in chunks (progress messages) until done:true. 
GitHub
Feeds chunks straight into the model’s context window or asks the model to summarise long documents.
4  Tool execution	tools/call {id:"create_sales_order", args:{…}}	result (or error) plus optional progress updates for long‑running jobs. 
GitHub
Inserts the result into the conversation as {"role":"tool","name":"…","content":…} so the model can reason on it.
5  Live prompts	prompts/get {id:"validate_rules.md"}	Markdown template	Injected as system or assistant messages so business rules travel with the data.
End‑to‑end example in your sales‑order scenario
bash
Copy
Edit
1. Agent asks hub:
   initialize → receives tool list (resolve_item, get_trade_price, …)

2. PDF PO already parsed; agent wants item master:
   resources/list           (hub advertises "d365://ReleasedProducts")
   resources/read (range)   → streams JSON (itemId, name, uom…)

3. Model decides to call tools:
   tools/call resolve_item  → {itemId:"M‑001", uom:"METER"}
   tools/call get_trade_price → {salesPrice:7.20}

4. Agent pulls live business rules:
   prompts/get validate_rules.md

5. After validation passes:
   tools/call create_sales_order → {SalesOrderNumber:"SO‑01725"}
During the whole flow:

Progress events let the UI show spinners or percentages.

Every request/response pair carries request_id, so Application Insights can stitch a full trace.

If the server emits capabilitiesUpdated, the host refreshes its cache—handy when you hot‑deploy a new tool. 
GitHub

Best‑practice tips
Chunk large resources (50 KB each). Azure AI Studio streams them into the model until the window is full, then automatically asks the LLM to summarise the remainder.

Type‑hint arguments in your tool schema (OpenAPI 3.1): the host validates user input before the call and gives the model autocomplete.

Return lightweight JSON—binary blobs (e.g. PDF) should be turned into base64 URLs stored in Blob Storage, not in the tool result.

Use cooldown metadata on expensive tools (e.g. credit check) so the host throttles repeat calls in the same conversation.

Why the split works
Agent context = Resources + Prompts – pure read‑only information pulled on demand.

Agent actions = Tools – explicit, side‑effecting calls gated by a discoverable contract.

Security – Managed Identity lives only in the hub; Agent Service sees results, not secrets.

Observability – JSON‑RPC envelopes give you uniform logs across every tool, whether it’s a quick lookup or a long D365 write.

Together, the initialize‑→ list‑→ read‑→ call dance lets the model “think with your data” while the hub cleanly slices read vs. write responsibilities.

resources/read	POST /mcp (often streamed)	Stream chunks into the model’s context.
tools/call	POST /mcp	Execute side‑effecting function; may stream progress.
They’re not RESTful URLs—just JSON‑RPC method names inside a single endpoint. 
Gist

4  Why Server‑Sent Events, not WebSockets?
SSE adds one header (Accept: text/event-stream) and works through corp firewalls.

Fits JSON‑RPC’s request/response ID matching without maintaining multiplexed channels.

Easy to downgrade: a non‑streaming server simply replies Content‑Type: application/json.

5  Security and versioning
Transport must be TLS; HTTP and SSE use the same certificate.

Bearer token (JWT, API key, Entra ID access token) sits in Authorization header.

Spec version is a date string ("mcp-version":"2025‑03‑26") in the initialize response so clients can adapt. 
Gist

TL;DR
If your agent is running in Azure AI Studio, each tool invocation is literally an HTTP POST to the hub’s /mcp endpoint carrying a JSON‑RPC envelope; if the tool streams progress, the same connection switches to text/event‑stream until [DONE] is sent. Swap the transport to STDIO for desktop integrations—the message format stays identical.

Shall we move the agent capabilities in the hub to simplify 
ChatGPT said:
Should you collapse everything into a single MCP hub?

Option	What you do	Upsides	Trade‑offs
Current split (Agent Service = orchestration, Hub = tools)	• DAG + prompts live in Agent Service.
• Business logic & data access live in hub (Container Apps).	Clear separation:
‑ Chat UX, retry & branching managed by Service.
‑ Hub can scale, reconnect, or be reused by other hosts (Copilot Studio, VS Code).	Two deploy artifacts (DAG YAML, hub image); capability handshake step.
“Fat” hub	Move the DAG YAML, prompts, and ReAct loop inside the hub; expose a single tool process_po().
Agent Service becomes just a chat UI calling one tool.	Single repo, single image, fewer moving parts; crash = one place to restart.	Lose Agent Service features: visual DAG editor, built‑in tracing UI, multi‑language tool wiring. You must re‑implement planner/executor, cancellation & timeout logic in Python/TS.
“Thin” hub + embedded micro‑tools	Keep small, stateless helpers (UoM conversion, date math) as Python Tool nodes in Agent Service; leave D365, credit, catalogue look‑ups in the hub.	Fewer network hops per order; no need to redeploy hub for every rule tweak.	Two code locations, version coordination still needed.
When not to merge
Multiple hosts need the tools
The same MCP hub can serve Azure AI Studio, Copilot Studio, Teams Bot Framework, or desktop agents. Merging DAG + prompts into the hub makes reuse harder.

Enterprise auth boundaries
Managed Identity & Key Vault secrets sit safely in the Container App pod. If you move logic into Agent Service you lose MSI and must pass tokens through the chat loop.

Road‑mapped Agent Service features
Microsoft’s Agent Service team is adding retry policies, human‑approval nodes, synthetic tests—all free if you stay split.

When a fat hub is acceptable

Characteristic	Good fit?
< 5 tools and a linear flow	✅
DevOps team wants one artifact to deploy	✅
On‑prem or air‑gapped install (no Agent Service allowed)	✅
Need full control over planner/executor code	✅ (but more work)
You’d keep the JSON‑RPC surface but add an internal planner that reads the PDF, calls local functions, and returns the final message to the model; think “function‑calling alpine style.”

Middle ground—Orchestrator pattern
Keep Agent Service DAG very thin:
receive_request → call do_sales_order()

Inside the hub, expose compound tools (do_sales_order) that internally call resolve_item, price, validate, etc.—but still allow those sub‑tools to be called individually for future flows (quotations, inventory queries).

This keeps the host–tool contract small (1 call) while preserving modular code inside the hub.

Recommendation

You care most about…	Stick with split?	Go monolithic?
Audit / tracing / future branching	Yes	No
Fastest PoC with tiny team	Maybe later	Yes
Reuse tools across products	Yes	No
On‑prem constraints	N/A	Yes
Start split (you already have it), then collapse only if operational overhead outweighs the benefits. You can always wrap the existing multi‑step hub calls behind a new single “mega‑tool” without deleting the DAG—giving you both simplicity and flexibility.

Let’s say that to perform an action we need to call multiple dynamics systems like field service in dataverse an fo asset management
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 13 seconds
Below is a proven pattern for one agent request that must touch two different Dynamics‑based back‑ends:

Field Service tables that live in Dataverse

Asset Management work‑order entities that live in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Mgt (FO)

It keeps your existing split—Agent Service for orchestration, one MCP hub for data & side‑effects—while adding “mini‑clients” inside the hub for each platform.

1  Tool design inside the hub

Tool ID	Dataverse / FO entity hit	Typical HTTP verb	Purpose
find_available_resources	msdyn_SearchResourceAvailability (custom API)

POST	Which technicians can do the work & when
create_field_service_work_order	msdyn_workorders (Dataverse table) 
Microsoft Learn
POST	Work order that appears in Field Service schedule board
get_asset_details	AssetTable / AssetTrans OData 
Microsoft Learn
GET	Serial #, warranty, hierarchy, etc.
create_asset_management_work_order	AssetWorkOrderHeaders OData

POST	FO work order in Asset Management
sync_status	Both sides	PATCH	Keep WO status in sync after completion

# Dataverse: uses OAuth2 'https://<org>.crm.dynamics.com/.default'
dv_token = msal.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=[f"{DV_URL}/.default"])

# FO / SCM: uses OAuth2 'https://<fo>.operations.dynamics.com/.default'
fo_token = msal.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=[f"{FO_URL}/.default"])
Cache tokens separately; both tenants can be in the same Entra ID or in different ones via multi‑tenant app registration.

2  Agent DAG (minimal)

Copy
Edit
graph TD
  ParsePO --> GetAsset(get_asset_details)
  GetAsset --> FindTech(find_available_resources)
  FindTech --> Branch{resource found?}
  Branch -- yes --> CreateFS(create_field_service_work_order)
  CreateFS --> CreateFO(create_asset_management_work_order)
  Branch -- no --> AskVendor(ask_vendor_reschedule)
  CreateFO --> Sync(sync_status)
  Sync --> Confirm(send_confirmation)
The agent still decides the order (Parse → Asset → Tech → FS WO → FO WO).

Each node is a tool call to the hub, but the hub knows which client (Dataverse vs FO) to use.

3  Why not embed everything in the agent?

Reason to stay in hub	Notes
Two auth audiences – Dataverse and FO require different AAD scopes; easier to manage in code than Agent Service Python nodes.	
Token caching & retry for 429/5xx	MCP hub can use requests_retry and circuit‑breaker.
Parallel IO – you may hit Dataverse and FO simultaneously (async/httpx) to reduce latency.	
Governance – Logs in one place; no secrets in the DAG.

One Docker image, one Container App; you set environment variables DV_URL, FO_URL, TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET.

Hub → Agent Service (result)

json
Copy
Edit
{"result":{"WarrantyStatus":"InWarranty"}}
Agent decides to create both work orders; subsequent calls hit Dataverse, then FO.

Hub streams progress events until both systems return 201.

6  Error handling pattern
Any Dataverse or FO 4xx/5xx becomes an MCP error (code, message, retryable).

Agent DAG can branch on retryable:false to show a vendor‑friendly apology or escalate to a human scheduler.

Bottom line
Keep the DAG inside Agent Service for clarity.

Add a thin client layer inside your existing MCP hub for each Dynamics subsystem.

Tools stay atomic—each does one thing against one system—so you can reorder or reuse them later for other flows (e.g., preventive maintenance only touches FO).

This approach gives a single public /mcp endpoint to the agent while hiding the complexity of two Dynamics APIs and their tokens behind your hub’s walls.

Or for example we have different legal entities in different dynamics ax and fo instances
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16 seconds
Scaling the pattern to many legal entities that live in several Dynamics instances
( e.g., legacy AX 2012 R3 for France + Spain, modern D365 FO for US + NL )

1  Connection strategy

Concern	Recommended approach
Instance boundary	Keep one logical MCP hub, but give it a client registry: every entry stores Base URL, Tenant ID, Client ID/Secret, Default company.
Company / legal entity	Add a mandatory company field to every tool argument. The hub injects the ?cross-company=true&company={company} query (FO) or &Company={dat} header (AX 2012 custom service). 
Microsoft Learn

Token caching	Cache Entra tokens per {instance, resource} key. AX 2012 uses legacy ADFS/ACS or custom OAuth proxy, so issue PAT tokens and cache them the same way.
Routing	A thin router decorator on each tool picks the correct client by inspecting company or an optional instance arg.
python
Copy
Edit
def route(instance_key):
    def decorator(func):
        async def wrapper(*args, company:str, **kw):
            cli = CLIENT_REGISTRY[instance_key]
            return await func(cli, *args, company=company, **kw)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
2  Tool surface the agent sees

Tool ID	Args	Routed to
get_trade_price	{item, customer, company}	US companies → FO; FR/ES → AX
create_sales_order	{header, lines, company}	Ditto
post_field_service_wo	{assetId, company}	Always Dataverse instance (single‑tenant)
The agent never sees “AX” or “FO”—only the company code.
During capability discovery the hub advertises a union of entities (SalesOrderHeadersV2, SalesTable, etc.); routing picks the right backend.

3  Typical flow with two back‑end calls
bash
Copy
Edit
1. Agent asks hub:
   tools/call get_trade_price {item:"M001", company:"FR01"}

2. Hub router ➜ AX 2012 OData*  (URL=https://axfr.contoso.com/.../data)
                                      *or AIF custom JSON service :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
3. Agent decides order is valid ➜ tools/call create_sales_order {company:"USMF"}
4. Hub router ➜ FO OData  (URL=https://fo-us.contoso.com/data/SalesOrderHeadersV2) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
Both actions share the same JSON‑RPC envelope and Auth header; only routing differs.

4  Multi‑instance secrets & infra

Where stored	Component
Client registry (URL + Tenant ID)	Azure App Config or Key Vault secrets with labels ax-fr, fo-us, …
Client ID / Secret	Key Vault; hub mounts local Managed Identity to fetch them.
Authority	AX 2012 may still use AD FS — store its token endpoint URL alongside the instance.
Deployment stays one Container App; environment variables:

ini
Copy
Edit
APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT=https://config-contoso.azconfig.io
KEYVAULT_NAME=kv-contoso
On warm‑up the hub reads the registry and builds client objects.

5  Agent orchestration unchanged
The DAG does not branch on instance; it only passes company.
If a rule spans multiple companies (e.g., “mirror a spare‑part PO in whichever instance the asset lives”) your DAG simply calls the same tool twice with different company codes.

yaml
Copy
Edit
- id: create_so_fr
  tool: create_sales_order
  args: ${$.fr_header}
- id: create_so_us
  tool: create_sales_order
  args: ${$.us_header}
6  Cross‑company consistency
Metadata – at initialize, the hub merges entity schemas (AX + FO) so the agent sees superset columns; properties not present in a given instance are silently ignored on write.

Idempotency – include the instance key in uniqueRequestId header FO supports; AX custom service can expose a check‑exists API first.

Error translation – AX SOAP/JSON faults map to MCP error codes (AX_VALIDATION_FAILED), FO OData 400/409 map as before.

7  Monitoring
One App Insights instance; add custom dimension instance_key so you can split charts by FO vs AX.

Use Azure Monitor Workbook to visualise latency per instance and per legal entity.

Take‑away
You don’t need multiple hubs or separate agents.
One MCP hub + router + per‑tool company argument cleanly supports any number of legal entities spread over different Dynamics AX/FO tenants—while the agent logic stays blissfully unaware of which backend it hit.

To guide you effectively: Could you clarify whether your main concern is about scalability, governance (different teams per instance), or runtime routing flexibility?

Also, are the tools (FO vs AX) meant to be interchangeable per DAG (e.g. same "create_sales_order" logic) or is each agent targeting a specific business unit or country?

That will help decide whether a single DAG with dynamic company routing is best, or multiple agent DAGs with tailored capabilities.

Got it. I’ll explore how to best structure Azure AI Agent Service DAGs when you have:

Many distinct business activities (sales order, work order, return order, pricing validation, etc.)

I’ll look into how to architect this using best practices like DAG modularization, tool inheritance, and agent routing patterns in Microsoft’s ecosystem. I’ll also include how to manage per-entity system targeting within a single agent, and when to split DAGs across agents.

I’ll update you shortly with a structured recommendation.

Modularizing Azure AI Agent Service DAGs for Complex Workflows
Overview
Building an Azure AI Agent to handle multiple Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations (FO/AX) business activities (e.g. creating sales orders, processing returns, pricing inquiries) across multiple legal entities presents architectural challenges. A naïve approach might use one monolithic DAG (directed acyclic graph) YAML to cover all possible flows, but this quickly becomes unmaintainable. Instead, a modular design is recommended, leveraging Azure AI Agent Service’s ability to compose agent flows and tools in a flexible way. Below, we outline best practices for structuring the agent with multiple DAGs, how to route logic based on legal entity or instance, when to use a single agent versus multiple agents, and techniques to keep configurations DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) – all using Microsoft-native components and current Azure AI Agent Service capabilities.
Modular DAGs per Business Activity
Split by Use Case: Organize your agent’s logic into separate agent flows (DAGs) for each business activity. For example, have distinct YAML flow definitions for “Sales Order Processing”, “Return Order Handling”, “Price Inquiry”, etc., rather than one gigantic flow covering all. Azure’s new Agent Flows feature allows an agent to trigger a predefined workflow, so you can maintain one DAG per use-case​
microsoft.com
. Each flow encapsulates the specific logic or tool sequence for that task, making it easier to develop, test, and update in isolation. Agents can pass context to the appropriate flow when needed​
microsoft.com
, executing that workflow deterministically. Reuse and Share Flows: By modularizing, you can also reuse common flows across agents or scenarios. Azure AI Agent Service supports coupling multiple flows with an agent, and the same flow can even be reused by different agents​
microsoft.com
. For example, a “Create Order” flow could be invoked by a Customer Service Agent and a Sales Agent alike. This promotes consistency and avoids duplicating logic across agents. Keep each flow’s scope focused (one business process), which also aligns with the agent flows concept of intelligent, deterministic workflow automation for repetitive tasks​
microsoft.com
. YAML Structure: In practice, maintain each activity’s flow in its own folder with a flow.dag.yaml (and supporting files). For instance:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
flows/
├── sales_order_flow/
│   ├── flow.dag.yaml
│   ├── prompts/
│   │   └── sales_order_prompt.jinja2
│   └── tools/
│       └── create_sales_order.py
├── return_order_flow/
│   ├── flow.dag.yaml
│   └── tools/
│       └── process_return.py
└── pricing_inquiry_flow/
    ├── flow.dag.yaml
    └── prompts/
        └── pricing_check.jinja2
Each flow.dag.yaml defines that workflow’s nodes (LLM prompts, function calls, etc.) and can accept inputs (like item details, quantities, etc.). This separation means you avoid one huge YAML and instead have modular, readable DAGs per activity. In Azure AI Studio’s Prompt Flow interface, each flow folder corresponds to one flow​
learn.microsoft.com
, which you can edit and version independently. Example: A simplified Sales Order flow YAML might contain an LLM prompt node to confirm order details, followed by a Python tool node that calls a Dynamics 365 FO API to create the order, and then an LLM node to compose a confirmation message. Meanwhile, a Return Order flow could have its own sequence (e.g. validate return eligibility, call a tool to create a return order, then summarize outcome). By keeping these flows separate, you can work on one without risking others, and only deploy updates for the flows that change.
Routing by Legal Entity and Instance
A single agent often needs to operate across multiple Dynamics 365 FO/AX instances or legal entities (company codes). Design your flows and tools to be parameterized based on the target environment:
Include Context Inputs: Define inputs in your flow for the legal_entity (company ID) and perhaps an instance identifier or URL. This way, the flow knows which ERP instance and company to act on. For example, your sales_order_flow.dag.yaml could define an input called company and use it when constructing API calls or in prompts (“Create the sales order in company ${input.company}”). The agent should capture or be provided this context from the user (e.g. “Create a sales order for USMF legal entity...”) so it can fill the input.
Parameterized Tools: Instead of hard-coding multiple tools for different instances, write tools that accept the target instance/tenant as a parameter. For example, a Python tool node CreateOrder might take an instance_url and legal_entity as inputs and use those to call the appropriate FO endpoint. In YAML, this could look like:
yaml
Copy
Edit
nodes:
  - name: create_order
    type: CustomFunction  # calls a Python function or Azure Function
    inputs:
      instance_url: ${input.instance_url}
      company: ${input.legal_entity}
    outputs:
      order_id: ${this.output.order_id}
The underlying function (in create_sales_order.py or an Azure Function) would contain the logic to connect to the specified FO instance’s API (using credentials for that instance, possibly looked up from config or Key Vault) and create the order in the given legal entity. By parameterizing, one tool definition serves all instances, keeping the flow DRY.
Conditional Logic: If certain steps differ per legal entity or instance, leverage the conditional execution features of Prompt Flow. Azure’s Prompt Flow DAG supports setting conditions (activate_when or similar) on nodes​
learn.microsoft.com
. For example, you might have two slightly different API call nodes for two product lines or two systems, and use a condition to execute one or the other based on an instance input value. If the condition isn’t met, that node is skipped (shown as “Bypassed”)​
learn.microsoft.com
. This avoids duplicating entire flows for each entity; you can include small conditional branches where needed.
Dynamic Routing Tool: In more complex scenarios, consider a “routing” function. For instance, a single Azure Function could accept a payload with the action (order vs return) and target instance, and internally route to the correct service or use the correct connection string. The agent’s flow then just calls this one function tool with parameters. This centralizes the multi-ERP routing logic in code.
Using Microsoft Connectors: Since we focus on Microsoft-native solutions, note that Agent Flows integrate with Power Platform connectors. You could convert existing Power Automate flows to agent flows​
learn.microsoft.com
, meaning if you already have a cloud flow for “Create Sales Order in D365FO,” that logic can be embedded as an action. Similarly, triggers and actions in agent flows can call Microsoft Dataverse or D365 actions. In Copilot Studio’s flow designer, you can drag in actions and choose the appropriate environment connection for each action step. However, to keep maintainability, prefer parameterized actions or at least group actions by scenario rather than duplicating one per company.
Routing within a Single Agent: The agent (powered by the LLM) can decide which flow to invoke based on user input. One pattern is to include a classification step: e.g., an initial LLM prompt that interprets the user’s request (“Is this a sales order, return, or pricing query?”) and sets a variable or selects the corresponding sub-flow. The Azure AI Agent can maintain a list of available flows it can run​
microsoft.com
. Once it identifies the needed activity, it passes control to the matching agent flow along with the context (including the legal entity parameter)​
microsoft.com
. This avoids hardcoding a giant branching script; instead the agent uses AI reasoning to route requests to the right modular workflow. If using the SDK or code-first approach, you might implement a simple routing logic outside the agent (e.g., in your API or bot framework layer) that calls the appropriate agent/flow based on a parsed command. But using the agent’s own intelligence to choose flows keeps the interaction seamless in one conversation. Just ensure the agent is instructed on how to choose flows (for example, via its system message or few-shot examples of requests and which flow to use).
Single Agent with Multiple Flows vs Multiple Agents
Deciding between one agent that handles everything versus multiple specialized agents is an important architectural consideration:
Single Agent with Multiple DAGs: A single agent can orchestrate multiple LLM calls and tools under one umbrella, which is often simpler for the user (one chat interface) and avoids duplicating global context or authentication. Thanks to agent flows, a single agent can still have a modular internal structure – essentially a unified agent that delegates to sub-flows for different tasks. This single-agent system is a good default for related tasks in the same domain​
learn.microsoft.com
​
learn.microsoft.com
. It allows dynamic decisions without the overhead of coordinating separate agents​
learn.microsoft.com
. All tools (e.g. FO APIs, search, etc.) can be in one toolset accessible to that agent. The trade-off is that the agent prompt and instructions must encompass a broader scope (covering all activities), and the internal logic must ensure the agent doesn’t confuse contexts. With proper modular flows and prompts, the agent can maintain clarity.
Multiple Agents (separate scopes): If the business activities are highly distinct or cross-functional, you might use multiple agents – for example, a “Sales Order Agent”, “Returns Agent”, and “Pricing Agent”. Each agent can be simpler and more focused (with its own instructions and toolset limited to that domain). This modularity at the agent level can make it easier to trace and debug each workflow, and reduces the prompt complexity per agent​
learn.microsoft.com
. It’s appropriate if you have clearly distinct domains or tasks, or a very large toolset that’s too big for one agent​
learn.microsoft.com
. However, a multi-agent setup introduces overhead: you need an external orchestrator or a master agent to direct queries to the right sub-agent, and maintaining many agents can become complex​
learn.microsoft.com
.
When to Split Agents: Consider separate agents if, for instance, sales order processing and returns processing are handled by different departments with little overlap, or if one requires access to tools/data the other should not have. Also, if your single agent’s prompt or flow collection becomes unwieldy even after modularization, that’s a sign to split. Microsoft’s guidance suggests moving to a multi-agent system only if you have distinct conversation contexts or domains that are hard to combine​
learn.microsoft.com
. Keep in mind that each Azure AI Agent Service agent is a deployable entity – if you create multiple, you’ll manage them (IDs, endpoints, credentials) separately. Ensure your integration (bot or app) knows which agent to invoke for which user request, possibly by a pre-routing or a user selection. Agent Registration Strategies: Whether one or many agents, plan how to register and identify them. In Azure AI Agent Service, each agent gets a name/ID. If using multiple agents, give them clear names and possibly segregate them in your project or resource hub (e.g. “FinanceAgent-SalesOrder”, “FinanceAgent-Returns”). The platform requires unique registrations for each agent​
learn.microsoft.com
, and if integrating with channels (like a chat channel), you might have to register each agent separately or have a dispatcher. In contrast, a single agent approach means one registration and one endpoint to call. You can still register multiple flows under that agent in Copilot Studio – the agent will have access to all those flows internally.
Keeping Tools, Prompts, and Rules DRY
With multiple flows and possibly multiple agents, it’s crucial to avoid duplicating code or prompt text across them:
Shared Prompt Templates: If you have common prompt instructions (for example, a standard system message about always checking certain rules, or a format guideline), externalize it into a template file and reference it in each flow. Using Jinja2 templates for prompts in Azure Prompt Flow, you can include sub-templates. For instance, maintain a common_instructions.jinja2 that contains general guidelines (or a large system prompt) and then each flow’s prompt can {% include 'common_instructions.jinja2' %} at the top. This way, if a policy or style change is needed, you update one file and all flows pick it up. (Ensure the file is present in each flow folder or accessible path — you might store it in each for now, or in a shared storage if supported.) Azure’s prompt flow doesn’t natively have a global template repository as of now, so a practical approach is to script the injection of common prompt text during CI/CD or use careful copy when updating multiple flows.
Parameterize Business Rules: Business logic variations (like approval limits, tax rules, etc.) that differ by legal entity or scenario should be data-driven, not hard-coded per flow. Consider using parameters or configuration files. For example, have a JSON or YAML file of business rules keyed by legal entity, which your Python tools can load. Or pass such rules into the flow as part of input. This keeps the flows generic – e.g., a “Process Return” flow can apply varying restocking fee rules based on the company code without having separate flows or divergent code paths scattered around.
Centralize External Integrations: If multiple flows need to call the same external service (like D365 FO API, a database, or an email sender), avoid writing similar code in each. You have a few options:
Use Azure Functions or Logic Apps: Azure AI Agent Service can integrate with Azure Functions​
learn.microsoft.com
. You can implement a function that encapsulates an action (e.g., “CreateOrderFunction”) and call it from any flow via the Function tool. This keeps the core logic in one place (the function code) and your flows just invoke it. Similarly, a Logic App (or Power Automate flow) could be called via an HTTP action to perform a task (like sending notifications or updating CRM). This approach leverages Microsoft serverless components and ensures if something changes (say an API endpoint or authentication method), you update the function/logic app rather than every flow.
Common Python Module: In a code-first approach, package common Python helper functions (for example, an erp_client.py with functions create_order(instance, data) and create_return(instance, data)). If you run your agent in Azure ML or similar, you could include this module in the environment or in each flow folder. Then each Python tool can simply import and call the shared function. This reduces code duplication, though you need to ensure the module stays in sync across flows. Using a private PyPI feed or including the module in the environment image is one way to have a single source of truth.
Shared Tool Configurations: Define tool connections or credentials once if possible. Azure AI Agent Service allows you to define connections (like Azure OpenAI, storage, etc.) that can be referenced by flows​
github.com
. For custom tools that need secrets (like D365 API keys or AAD tokens), use Azure Key Vault integration or environment variables so that all flows draw from the same secret store rather than each having its own copy. For instance, store multiple FO instance URLs and credentials in Key Vault and have your tool code read from there based on the instance parameter. This keeps sensitive info out of the YAML and ensures updates (password rotations, new instance additions) are done in one place.
Avoid Repetition in YAML: YAML doesn’t support native inheritance, but you can use anchors/aliases for some repetition within a single file. However, since we are splitting flows, repetition across files is a concern. Emphasize designing each flow to be as simple as possible, delegating to shared code or functions for complex logic. The flows primarily orchestrate what to do (call this function, then that one) rather than how to do it in detail. This high-level orchestration is less likely to be duplicated exactly – but if you notice patterns (e.g., many flows do “lookup customer data” as a first step), you might spin that off into a sub-flow or function that all can call.
YAML and Deployment Considerations for Scale
Maintaining multiple YAML-defined flows and agents requires a solid DevOps process:
Version Control for Flows: Treat each flow’s folder as source code. Use a Git repository to manage the flow.dag.yaml and associated prompt/tool files. Microsoft’s prompt flow tooling supports exporting and importing flow definitions so you can store them in a repo. In fact, Azure AI services documentation highlights that you can define flow files in YAML, keep them in a code repo, and version them alongside your code​
learn.microsoft.com
. This means any changes to a flow can go through code review and CI before being deployed to Azure.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate the deployment of your agent flows and agent configurations. Azure offers a Prompt Flow CLI/SDK and Azure AI Agent Service SDK that you can use in pipelines. For example, you might have a GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline that, on commit to main, runs a script to import updated flow YAMLs into the Azure AI Agent Service (or uses the project_client from the SDK to update the agent). This ensures your development, test, and production environments stay in sync with the repository. Additionally, you can automatically run flow tests as part of CI – e.g., using pf run CLI to execute a flow with sample input and verify outputs (important for catching issues in complex DAG logic).
Organizing Projects/Hubs: In Azure AI Foundry (Copilot Studio), you might create separate projects or hubs for different stages or teams. One strategy is to have a “Dev” project where flows are first created and tried out, and a “Prod” project for the live agent. Using automated export/import, you can promote flows from Dev to Prod. Alternatively, use a single project but maintain multiple agents – one agent could be a staging agent and another the production agent, each connected to the same set of flows but perhaps different configurations or versions. Be mindful that standard (single-tenant) agent setups allow more control over resources, whereas basic setups are limited to the portal UI for now​

​

, so plan your CI/CD approach accordingly (the standard setup with SDK control is preferable for large-scale maintainability).
Agent Registration & Endpoint Management: As you deploy, keep track of agent IDs, keys, or endpoints. If you go with one agent, you’ll update that agent’s flows in place. If you have multiple agents (micro-agents by domain), you might register each in an infrastructure-as-code way (e.g., using Bicep or ARM templates if supported, or via the SDK). Ensure your pipeline can create or update agents in Azure (for example, using the agents.create_agent and similar SDK calls to register tools and instructions​
learn.microsoft.com
​
learn.microsoft.com
). For each new flow added to an agent, you may need to update the agent’s allowed tools or actions list (the Copilot Studio interface shows a list of flows available to an agent​
microsoft.com
). Include that in your deployment scripts – e.g., a config file that maps which flows belong to which agent.
Testing and Monitoring: At scale, with many flows, implement robust testing. Each DAG should have unit tests (simulate inputs and validate outputs or tool calls). Azure’s trace feature for flows can help debug conditional logic​
learn.microsoft.com
. Also monitor the usage: since agent flows consume Copilot Studio capacity per action​
learn.microsoft.com
, track if certain flows are heavy and maybe optimize or schedule them during off-peak times if possible. Logging is important – consider adding logging within your Python tools or using the SDK to log when a flow is invoked and what branch was taken, so you can audit the agent’s behavior across entities.
By following these practices, you avoid a “God agent” with a single sprawling YAML. Instead, you’ll have a collection of focused DAGs, orchestrated intelligently by the agent, with clear routing for different legal entities and a maintainable codebase. This modular approach leverages Azure AI Agent Service’s native capabilities – from agent flows to tool integrations – to build a scalable, enterprise-grade solution.

Feels like a classic requisition-style agent is an easy one here, but interested to see what thoughts you all have. Given that Build is primarily a 'developer' conference, it seems like part of the challenge is to show 'why' MCP - we have already deployed MCP 'like' webapis at customers using semantic kernel, publishing the webapi via power platform custom connectors, to be able to use the web api methods as generative actions. I think there are a few angles:
	1.	obviously we want to show the 1st party dynamics MCP actions from MS
	2.	potentially combine this with actions from other third party MCP servers
	3.	also potentially combined with our own custom MCP actions (even if they are just a wrapper to our existing AI Actions)
Similarly, as a developer - why MCP? It's a standard that can be used from any MCP compliant host/client. So enabling generative actions from dynamics to copilot studio - no big deal we can do that already in low code power automate flows, X++ actions, and even authenticated webapi methods using power platform custom connectors. It seems to me that being able to use 3rd party MCP servers is really the draw here - and also making our dynamics and custom MCP actions available externally (Claude desktop, etc) for consumption - not only through power platform.

“Why MCP?” — the quick pitch you can give on stage

What developers do today	What MCP adds (in one sentence)
Publish a Web API or a Power Platform custom connector, then hand‑craft a prompt or flow to call it.	One 50‑line server that every GPT‑/Claude‑/Copilot‑/VS Code host can auto‑discover, type‑check and stream from — no extra glue.
Wire Dynamics + third‑party actions in Power Automate or SK skill code.	Hot‑swap any mix of 1st‑party D365 actions, third‑party MCP servers, or your own wrappers under the same client without redeploying the host.
Re‑implement auth, retries, progress and cancellation per API.	JSON‑RPC spec already defines them; host UIs (Studio, Claude Desktop) surface spinners, cancel buttons and streaming logs automatically.
So the Build story is: “You already know how to expose a Dynamics Web API; watch how, by speaking MCP instead, the exact same endpoint lights up instantly inside Copilot Studio, ChatGPT, Claude Desktop and Teams — and can compose with any other MCP tool the community ships.”

Demo skeleton that highlights all three angles

Step	On‑stage moment	What the audience sees
1️⃣ Spin up two servers	mcpdynamics serve (1st‑party D365 actions) and mcp install stripe (third‑party payments)	Both list themselves in a single capabilities JSON in the console.
2️⃣ Add your custom wrapper	python shipstation_mcp.py exposes one create_label tool	Console log: “advertising create_label(labelOptions)”.
3️⃣ Attach servers to Copilot Studio	Settings ▸ Tools ▸ Add Server → paste localhost URLs	The tool palette auto‑refreshes—no Swagger import, no auth screens.
4️⃣ Open the chat	“Create a field‑service work order, take a 10 % deposit on Stripe, then ship replacement part.”	Studio shows streaming tool calls: create_work_order, stripe.create_payment_intent, create_label.
5️⃣ Flip the host	Open Claude Desktop, point it at the same servers.	Exact same typed calls run; no code change.
Why developers lean forward
Zero boilerplate 🤝 Capability discovery means no connector wizards.

Type safety 💪 LLM autocompletes valid JSON args because the server advertises JSON Schema.

Composable 🪄 You chained a Microsoft‑hosted D365 tool, a community Stripe tool, and your own ShipStation wrapper in <60 s.

FAQ bullets for the slide deck
“Isn’t this just custom connectors?” — Connectors tie you to Power Platform; MCP also runs in every other LLM host and keeps streaming, cancellation, tool typing and auth rules consistent across them.

“Do I need to ditch SK skills?” — No: wrap any existing skill in a 10‑line MCP adapter and gain multi‑host reach.

“Security?” — Servers run behind the same Azure AD app registrations you already use; clients pass Bearer tokens, and every tool declares scopes so the host asks end‑users for consent.

“How big can a catalog get?” — Discovery is paged and typed; GitHub’s public hub already exposes ~1,300 tools without performance hits.

Take‑away message for Build
“MCP is the USB‑C of AI actions: plug once, light up everywhere.”
Dynamics, third‑party APIs and your own code all become first‑class, typed, cancellable tools that any LLM host can call — and you wrote almost no extra plumbing.

To consolidate internally here, just saw this update from MS
 
"Jeff Dunmall (Guest) Ken Heiman and Jim Bretschneider (Guest) wanted to share additional info. we now know the endpoints we plan to expose via MCP. we would need partner agents to use at least one of these endpoints
 
Get Unmatched Invoices #Finance
 
Get Customer Payment History #Finance
 
Get Customer Remaining Credit #Finance
 
Get Customer Credit Limit #Finance
 
Get Customer Collections Summary #Finance
 
Get Open Requisitions #SCM
Get Products #SCM 
Get Trade Agreements for Items And Vendors #SCM 
Get Approved Vendors for Products #SCM 
Assign suppliers to Requisition lines #SCM 
Create Purchase Orders from Requisitions #SCM
 
as you think through your scenarios please see if you can leverage some of these endpoints. please feel free to ping with any questions you may have - but i see we have a call scheduled for Tue AM
 
we have some (But not a lot) flexibility to expose additional, simple endpoints - so if that's a blocker we can discuss Tue. thanks and have a great weekend"

Great news — these Finance & SCM endpoints slot straight into the agent flows we’ve been sketching.
Below is a quick map of where each Microsoft‑hosted MCP action can live inside our modular DAGs, plus one‑liner use‑cases we can demo at Build. (Anything in bold is an endpoint you just confirmed.)


Flow / use‑case	Finance MCP endpoint(s)	SCM MCP endpoint(s)	Purpose in the flow
Sales‑Order Validation	Get Customer Credit Limit
Get Customer Remaining Credit
Get Customer Collections Summary	—	Replace our ad‑hoc check_credit() tool; zero custom OData needed.
Collections Copilot (“Why hasn’t Contoso paid?”)	Get Unmatched Invoices
Get Customer Payment History	—	LLM can summarise overdue invoices and last‑payment streak.
Requisition‑to‑PO (classic buy‑off‑replen)	—	Get Open Requisitions
Assign Suppliers to Req Lines
Create Purchase Orders from Requisitions	Automates tactical purchasing; we add a prompt step to justify supplier choice.
Quick Quote / Price Check	—	Get Trade Agreements for Items and Vendors	Lets the agent answer “What’s my cost if I buy 1 000 bolts from Fabrikam?”
Item Discovery	—	Get Products
Get Approved Vendors for Products	Supports “Find me an approved supplier for part M‑001.”
How we’ll wire them into the architecture
Finance MCP server ↔ tools above tagged #Finance

SCM MCP server ↔ tools tagged #SCM

Our existing custom hub still hosts cross‑system glue (e.g., multi‑instance routing, unit‑conversion, direct‑delivery PO).

The agent’s DAGs stay modular – we drop these first‑party tools into the relevant flow folder; no YAML explosion.

ParsePO --> get_products  --> assign_suppliers --> create_po

         get_credit_limit  (new #Finance)
Each tool arrives with a JSON schema, so the LLM gets argument autocompletion and typed results out of the box.

Two demo ideas for Build
“From Overdue Invoice to PO”

Chat shows an accounts‑receivable agent pulling Unmatched Invoices, summarising top delinquencies, then (if customer is over credit) invoking Assign Suppliers and Create PO to rush‑order spare parts.

“One Prompt, Three Systems”

In Claude Desktop:

“Create a replenishment PO for any open requisition on company FR01, but block lines where customer Contoso is already over credit.”

Flow calls Get Open Requisitions (#SCM), Get Customer Credit Limit (#Finance), then uses our custom inventory lookup before issuing Create PO (#SCM).

Gaps we might still need (for the call on Tue)

Desired action	Reason	Could MS expose?
Get On‑hand Inventory by Site/Warehouse	validate 20 % stock‑cap rule	SCM
Create Sales Order Header/Lines	full quote‑to‑cash demo	Finance/SCM
Update Credit Hold Status	auto‑release after payment	Finance
If any of these are feasible as “simple extras,” they’d let us keep all ERP writes first‑party rather than in custom code.

Next steps before Tuesday
We’ll patch our hub to treat the new servers as first‑class tool sources (no extra auth glue required if they ship with AAD).

Draft mini‑flows for the two Build demos above and share the YAML for feedback.

Come prepared with the short wish‑list (inventory, SO create, credit‑hold release) in case there’s bandwidth for one more endpoint.

Ping me if you want the initial YAML or need clarification on how we’ll surface these in Copilot Studio vs Claude Desktop.
