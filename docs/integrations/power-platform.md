# Integration: Power Platform

Integrate your D365 Agent seamlessly with Power Apps and Power Automate using custom connectors or HTTP requests.

## Power Automate

*   **Creating a Custom Connector:** [Steps to define a connector based on your agent's API]
*   **Calling the Agent from a Flow:** [Using the custom connector or HTTP action to trigger agent actions]
*   **Passing Data:** [Sending data from the flow to the agent and receiving responses]
*   **Example Flow:** [A sample flow demonstrating a common integration pattern (e.g., triggering an agent action when a D365 record changes)]

## Power Apps (Canvas Apps)

*   **Using a Custom Connector:** [Adding the connector to your app]
*   **Calling the Agent from Power Fx:** [Formulas to interact with the agent API]
*   **Displaying Agent Responses:** [Binding agent data to controls]
*   **Example App:** [A simple Canvas App showcasing agent interaction]

## Power Pages / Portals (If Applicable)

*   [Methods for calling the agent API from Power Pages (e.g., via JavaScript, Power Automate, or backend APIs)]

## Considerations

*   [Authentication methods for custom connectors]
*   [Handling asynchronous operations]
*   [Error handling strategies]
