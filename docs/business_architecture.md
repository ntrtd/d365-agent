# Business Architecture: As-Is vs. To-Be with Dynamics 365 AI Agent

This document outlines the current ("As-Is") business processes related to Dynamics 365 interactions and contrasts them with the envisioned future state ("To-Be") enabled by the AI Agent leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 1. As-Is Business Architecture (Current State)

**Overview:** Current processes often involve significant manual effort, fragmented communication channels, and potentially bespoke or limited integrations between Dynamics 365 modules, instances, and external systems.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Manual Data Entry & Processing:**
    *   Internal staff often manually enter data from emails, PDFs (like POs), or other documents into Dynamics 365.
    *   Processing tasks like matching customer item numbers, validating orders against complex rules (credit, inventory, unit conversion), and creating related documents (e.g., POs for non-stock items) require manual lookups and actions within D365.
*   **Fragmented User Interaction:**
    *   Internal users rely on navigating multiple D365 screens or modules to gather information or perform tasks.
    *   External users (customers, vendors) interact through separate channels (email, phone calls, specific portal logins) often requiring manual follow-up from internal staff. Information retrieval (e.g., order status, pricing) can be slow.
*   **Siloed Information & Processes:**
    *   Accessing information or executing processes that span multiple D365 modules (e.g., checking SCM inventory availability while creating a Finance sales order) or multiple D365 instances (different legal entities in FO/AX) can be complex and require switching contexts or manual coordination.
    *   Integration with external systems (vendor catalogues, shipping carriers, payment providers) may be limited, non-existent, or rely on custom point-to-point integrations requiring ongoing maintenance.
*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:**
    *   Business rules (pricing, credit checks, validation logic) may be applied inconsistently depending on the user, channel, or manual process adherence. Updates to rules can be slow to propagate.
*   **Limited Proactivity:**
    *   Systems are primarily reactive. Identifying issues (e.g., potential stock-outs based on open requisitions, overdue invoices needing follow-up) relies heavily on manual reporting and user diligence.
*   **High Operational Overhead:**
    *   Significant time is spent on repetitive tasks, data reconciliation, error correction, and responding to routine inquiries, impacting efficiency and increasing operational costs.

## 2. To-Be Business Architecture (Future State with AI Agent)

**Overview:** The AI Agent acts as an intelligent, conversational interface and automation engine, streamlining interactions with Dynamics 365 and connected systems for both internal and external users. It leverages MCP for standardized access to data and functions.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Automated Data Ingestion & Processing:**
    *   The AI agent automatically ingests and parses information from various channels and formats (emails, PDFs, chat messages) using AI services.
    *   Tasks like item matching (internal/external IDs), price lookups (trade agreements), validation against complex rules (credit, inventory, UoM), and creation of related D365 documents (Sales Orders, Purchase Orders) are automated via agent flows and MCP tools.
*   **Unified Conversational Interface:**
    *   Internal and external users interact with D365 capabilities through a consistent conversational interface (chat, voice, potentially integrated into existing portals/tools).
    *   The agent provides a single point of contact for inquiries and task execution, reducing the need to navigate complex D365 UIs.
*   **Seamless Cross-Module & Cross-Instance Operations:**
    *   The agent orchestrates workflows that span multiple D365 modules (Finance, SCM, Asset Management, etc.) and instances (multiple legal entities/companies in FO/AX) seamlessly. This is achieved via the standardized MCP interface, allowing the agent to invoke tools exposed by the MCP Hub, which handles the underlying routing and interaction logic for different D365 instances or external systems.
    *   **Composability:** Unlike bespoke APIs or platform-specific connectors, MCP allows easy integration and composition of capabilities from diverse sources (first-party D365, third-party services, custom logic) within a single agent flow without requiring modifications to the host or complex integration layers.
*   **Consistent & Flexible Rule Enforcement:**
    *   Business rules are consistently applied by the agent during validation steps within predefined flows (DAGs).
    *   Flexibility is introduced by allowing certain rules (e.g., validation thresholds, conversion factors) to be configured or potentially adjusted via prompts (within defined guardrails).
*   **Proactive Assistance & Insights:**
    *   The agent can potentially monitor D365 data (leveraging MCP tools retrieving specific datasets like open requisitions, overdue payments) and proactively alert users or suggest actions (e.g., "Recommend creating POs for these requisitions," "Suggest follow-up on these overdue customer accounts").
    *   It can provide quick answers to complex queries by synthesizing information retrieved from multiple D365 entities or external sources.
*   **Reduced Operational Overhead & Improved User Experience:**
    *   Automation of repetitive tasks frees up internal staff for higher-value activities.
    *   Faster response times and self-service capabilities improve the experience for both internal and external users.
    *   Standardized integration via MCP reduces the complexity and cost of maintaining multiple point-to-point connections.
*   **Enhanced Governance & Observability:**
    *   Structured agent flows (DAGs) and comprehensive telemetry provide clear audit trails and insights into automated processes.
    *   Centralized business logic within the MCP Hub (for privileged operations) ensures consistency and control. The use of structured Agent Flows (DAGs) within the AI Agent Service provides predictability and transparency for complex multi-step processes, superior to less structured prompt chaining.

**Transition:** Moving from "As-Is" to "To-Be" involves implementing the technical architecture (AI Agent Service, MCP Hub, integrations) and progressively rolling out agent capabilities, starting with high-impact, well-defined processes like PO processing, and expanding based on business value and user feedback.
