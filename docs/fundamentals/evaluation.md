# Evaluating Your Dynamics 365 AI Agent

Evaluating your AI agent built with the Dynamics 365 AI Agent SDK is a fundamental activity throughout its development lifecycle. This ensures it meets functional requirements, performs reliably, adheres to safety and quality standards, and effectively utilizes its underlying capabilities.

## 1. Goals of Evaluation

When evaluating your agent, focus on these key areas:

*   **Functional Correctness:** Does the agent correctly understand user intent? Does it execute the appropriate workflows or logic? Does it interact accurately with Dynamics 365 and other backend systems via MCP tools?
*   **Reliability & Robustness:** How well does the agent handle varied inputs, edge cases, unexpected scenarios, and potential errors?
*   **Performance:** What is the latency of agent responses? How efficiently does it use resources during backend processing?
*   **Safety & Responsibility:** Does the agent exhibit potential biases? Are there security vulnerabilities? Does it align with responsible AI principles?
*   **User Satisfaction:** How effectively does the agent help users achieve their goals?
*   **MCP Tool Effectiveness & Refinement:** Analyze agent behavior, identify interaction patterns, and pinpoint shortcomings or missing functionalities. Use these insights to drive the iterative development and improvement of the underlying MCP tools, ensuring they adequately support the agent's required capabilities.

## 2. Types of Evaluations & Tests

A multi-layered evaluation approach is recommended:

1.  **Unit Tests (MCP Tools):**
    *   **Focus:** Testing individual MCP tool implementations within your MCP Server.
    *   **Method:** Mock external dependencies (like Dynamics 365 API calls) to test the tool's logic, data handling, and error management in isolation.
    *   **Tools:** Standard unit testing frameworks suitable for your MCP Server's language (e.g., Jest/Vitest for TypeScript, xUnit/NUnit for .NET).
2.  **Integration Tests (MCP Server & Backends):**
    *   **Focus:** Verifying the interaction between your MCP Server tools and actual backend systems (e.g., a Dynamics 365 sandbox, external APIs).
    *   **Method:** Invoke MCP tools (e.g., via simulated MCP requests) and check the interactions with the connected systems (e.g., data created/updated in the sandbox). Requires a properly configured test environment.
    *   **Tools:** Test clients capable of sending MCP requests (like JSON-RPC), orchestrated by testing frameworks.
3.  **Orchestration Logic Evaluation (Agent Backend/Client):**
    *   **Focus:** Assessing the logic that coordinates MCP tool calls, handles conversation flow, and manages agent state (e.g., using frameworks like AutoGen, LangChain, or custom DAGs). This includes testing prompt effectiveness, conditional paths, and tool sequences.
    *   **Method:** Run orchestration flows with diverse test inputs. Evaluate the outputs against expected results or quality metrics. Mocking MCP tool responses can be useful initially. Unit tests for specific orchestration components are also valuable.
    *   **Tools:** Standard testing frameworks, specific features of your chosen orchestration framework (if available), manual review of execution traces/logs.
4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Scenario Testing:**
    *   **Focus:** Validating complete user scenarios, starting from the user interface or entry point, through all backend components (Agent Backend, MCP Server), to Dynamics 365 and back.
    *   **Method:** Simulate user interactions (e.g., chat messages, API calls) based on key use cases. Verify the final outcome and the complete system behavior.
    *   **Tools:** Test automation frameworks interacting with your agent's UI or API endpoints, manual testing following detailed test plans.
5.  **Prompt Engineering & Evaluation:**
    *   **Focus:** Systematically assessing and refining the quality, safety, and effectiveness of prompts used by the LLM within your agent's orchestration logic.
    *   **Method:** Use techniques like A/B testing prompt variants, red teaming (attempting to elicit undesirable responses), and evaluating LLM outputs against metrics like groundedness (for RAG), relevance, coherence, and safety.
    *   **Tools:** Evaluation platforms (e.g., Azure AI Studio), custom evaluation scripts, manual analysis.
6.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   **Focus:** Measuring response latency, throughput, and resource consumption under realistic load conditions.
    *   **Method:** Use load testing tools to simulate concurrent users or requests targeting your agent's endpoints and backend services.
    *   **Tools:** Tools like Azure Load Testing, K6, JMeter. Monitor results using observability platforms (e.g., Application Insights).
7.  **Security Testing:**
    *   **Focus:** Identifying potential vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization, data privacy, prompt injection, dependency security, and interactions with external systems.
    *   **Method:** Employ techniques like penetration testing, static/dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST), dependency scanning, and thorough reviews of security configurations.
    *   **Tools:** Security scanning tools, manual security reviews by experts.

## 3. Key Metrics

Consider tracking metrics like:

*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of user interactions successfully completed.
*   **Accuracy/Correctness:** Factual accuracy of information provided, correctness of actions taken in D365.
*   **Groundedness:** How well responses are supported by provided data (especially in RAG scenarios).
*   **Relevance:** How pertinent the agent's response is to the user's query.
*   **Coherence/Fluency:** Readability and naturalness of generated language.
*   **Latency:** End-to-end response time, duration of specific internal steps (including MCP tool calls).
*   **Reliability:** Success rate of workflows and tool calls, error rates.
*   **Safety:** Rate of detecting and mitigating harmful outputs or jailbreak attempts.
*   **Cost:** Resource consumption per interaction (e.g., API calls, compute).
*   **User Satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback, ratings, or CSAT scores.
*   **MCP Tool Usage Frequency & Success Rate:** Track which tools are used most often and their success/failure rates to identify bottlenecks or areas needing improvement.

## 4. Methodology & Tooling

*   **Test Datasets:** Develop and maintain curated datasets representing diverse inputs, common use cases, edge cases, and expected outputs for different scenarios.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate automated tests (Unit, Integration) into your CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions early. Consider running E2E tests post-deployment or on a regular schedule.
*   **Manual Review:** Supplement automated testing with regular manual review of agent interactions, logs, and evaluation results, especially for subjective quality aspects and nuanced behaviors.
*   **Telemetry Analysis & Feedback Loop:** Utilize logging and monitoring (e.g., Application Insights) to understand real-world usage patterns, identify common failures, and gather data for continuous improvement. Crucially, establish a feedback loop where insights from agent behavior analysis (e.g., failed interactions, unexpected tool usage patterns) directly inform the backlog and priorities for MCP tool development and refinement.

By implementing a comprehensive evaluation strategy focused not just on the agent but also on the effectiveness of its underlying tools, you can build more robust, reliable, and capable AI agents using the Dynamics 365 AI Agent SDK.
