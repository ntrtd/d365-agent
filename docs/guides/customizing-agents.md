# Guide: Customizing Agents

The D365 Agent SDK provides various ways to customize and extend the behavior of your agents. This guide covers common customization techniques.

## Configuration

*   **Settings Files:** [How to use configuration files (e.g., appsettings.json) to control SDK behavior]
*   **Programmatic Configuration:** [Code examples for setting options during initialization]
*   **Key Configuration Options:**
    *   [Logging levels]
    *   [Timeout settings]
    *   [Feature flags]
    *   [Connection parameters]

## Adding Custom Actions/Intents

*   **Defining New Capabilities:** [How partners can define their own agent actions or respond to specific intents]
    *   [Code examples using relevant SDK classes/interfaces]
*   **Registering Custom Components:** [How to make the SDK aware of custom logic]

## Middleware and Pipelines (If Applicable)

*   **Extending the Request Pipeline:** [If the SDK supports middleware, explain how to add custom steps to process requests/responses]
    *   [Example: Adding custom validation or logging middleware]

## Overriding Default Behavior (If Applicable)

*   **Replacing Core Components:** [If possible, explain how partners can substitute default implementations with their own (e.g., custom state management)]

## Best Practices

*   [Structuring custom code]
*   [Testing customizations]
