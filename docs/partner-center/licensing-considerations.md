# Partner Guide: Licensing Considerations

Understanding the licensing implications is crucial when building and selling solutions that utilize the D365 Agent SDK.

**Disclaimer:** *This is general guidance. Always consult the official Microsoft Dynamics 365 licensing documentation and your Partner Development Manager (PDM) for definitive information.*

## SDK Licensing

*   **Your Use of the SDK:** [Clarify any licensing terms associated with the D365 Agent SDK itself - is it free to use for partners? Are there specific conditions?]
*   **Distribution Rights:** [Are there limitations on how partners can bundle or distribute the SDK components?]

## Dynamics 365 Licensing (End Customer)

*   **Required D365 Licenses:** What D365 licenses must the end customer possess to use the functionality enabled by your agent solution?
    *   [Consider base licenses (e.g., Sales Enterprise, Customer Service Enterprise)]
    *   [Any specific add-on licenses required for the APIs or data entities your agent interacts with (e.g., specific AI features, API call limits)?]
*   **User Types:** Does the interaction pattern affect licensing (e.g., multiplexing considerations)?
    *   [Guidance on licensing for users interacting indirectly via the agent vs. direct D365 users]
*   **API Call Limits:** Be mindful of the customer's Dataverse API call limits.
    *   [Recommendations for efficient API usage within your agent]
    *   [Guidance for customers on monitoring their API consumption]

## Your Solution Licensing

*   **Your Pricing Model:** How will you license your solution to the customer (e.g., per user, per tenant, consumption-based)?
*   **Dependency Clarity:** Clearly communicate the required D365 licenses as prerequisites for your solution.
