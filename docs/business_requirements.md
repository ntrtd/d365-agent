# High-Level Business Requirements: Dynamics 365 AI Agent via MCP

These requirements outline the general capabilities for an AI agent designed to interact with various Microsoft Dynamics 365 modules (including Finance, Supply Chain Management, Dataverse/Field Service, legacy AX) and potentially external systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

1.  **Multi-Channel Interaction:**
    *   The agent should be accessible and usable through various channels, including email, chat interfaces (web, Teams), and voice interactions, catering to different user preferences and contexts.

2.  **Dual User Focus (Internal & External):**
    *   The agent must be designed to serve both internal users (e.g., employees needing assistance with D365 tasks, data retrieval, or process automation) and external third-party users (e.g., customers placing orders, vendors submitting invoices or checking status).
    *   Context, permissions, and available actions should adapt based on whether the user is internal or external.

3.  **Data Ingestion and Understanding:**
    *   The agent must be able to receive and parse information from various formats, including structured data, unstructured text (emails), and documents (e.g., PDFs).
    *   Leverage AI services (like Azure Document Intelligence) to extract relevant data points from ingested information.

4.  **Cross-Module Dynamics 365 Interaction:**
    *   The agent needs the capability to query data from and execute transactions across different Dynamics 365 modules (Finance, SCM, Field Service, Asset Management, etc.) via standardized interfaces (like OData exposed through MCP).
    *   Support for interacting with multiple Dynamics 365 instances (e.g., different legal entities, legacy AX instances alongside modern FO) based on context (e.g., company code).

5.  **Intelligent Data Mapping and Resolution:**
    *   The agent should be able to map external identifiers (e.g., customer part numbers, vendor names) to internal Dynamics 365 records (items, customers, vendors).
    *   Perform lookups based on descriptions or partial information.

6.  **Business Rule Application and Validation:**
    *   The system must enforce configurable business rules and perform validations before committing transactions (e.g., credit limit checks, inventory availability, pricing rules, unit conversions).
    *   Allow for flexibility where rules might be adaptable, potentially through configuration or prompt engineering by business users.

7.  **External System Integration:**
    *   The agent should be capable of interacting with third-party systems or data sources (e.g., external vendor catalogues via CSV/API, payment gateways like Stripe, shipping providers like ShipStation) through MCP tools.

8.  **Complex Workflow Orchestration:**
    *   The agent must be able to execute multi-step business processes that may involve querying multiple systems, applying validation logic, making decisions (potentially with human-in-the-loop for exceptions/approvals), and committing transactions across systems (e.g., creating related Sales and Purchase Orders).
    *   Support structured execution flows (e.g., using DAGs) for predictability and auditability.

9.  **Contextual Awareness and Personalization:**
    *   The agent should operate within the context of the specific user (internal or external) interacting with it, applying appropriate permissions, pricing, and process variations.

10. **Confirmation and Notification:**
    *   Provide clear confirmation of successful transactions or status updates back through the original interaction channel.
    *   Handle error scenarios gracefully and provide informative feedback.

11. **Observability and Learning:**
    *   The agent's interactions and decisions should be traceable through comprehensive logging and telemetry.
    *   Incorporate mechanisms for learning and improvement based on operational data and user feedback, potentially suggesting new capabilities or refinements.

**Goal:** To create versatile AI agents that can automate and assist with a wide range of Dynamics 365 related business processes for both internal employees and external partners/customers, leveraging the standardization and composability offered by MCP to integrate seamlessly with various data sources and tools within the Microsoft ecosystem and beyond.
