# Welcome to the Dynamics 365 AI Agent Documentation

This site provides documentation related to the design and architecture of an AI-powered agent for interacting with Microsoft Dynamics 365 using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

The goal is to create versatile AI agents that can automate and assist with a wide range of Dynamics 365 related business processes for both internal employees and external partners/customers. This leverages the standardization and composability offered by MCP to integrate seamlessly with various data sources and tools within the Microsoft ecosystem and beyond.
