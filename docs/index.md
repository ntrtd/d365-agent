# Welcome to the Dynamics 365 AI Agent Documentation

This site provides documentation related to the design and architecture of an AI-powered agent for interacting with Microsoft Dynamics 365 using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

The goal is to create a suite of specialized AI agents, each focused on a specific functional area (e.g., Sales, Procurement, Finance, Asset Management, Field Service), that can automate and assist with a wide range of Dynamics 365 related business processes. These agents will serve both internal employees and external partners/customers. The architecture leverages the standardization and composability offered by MCP to allow these specialized agents to integrate seamlessly with various data sources and tools (often via a shared MCP Hub) within the Microsoft ecosystem and beyond. An example implementation could be a Sales Agent utilizing MCP tools for opportunity management, quoting, and order entry, or a Procurement Agent focused on requisition processing and purchase order creation.
