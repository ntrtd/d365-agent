# Phase 4: Optimization, Self-Learning & Wider Rollout

*   **Goal:** Optimize performance across **multiple specialized agents** (in `d365-agent-service`) and the shared MCP Hub (in `d365-agent-hub`, using the **SAP Cloud SDK client package `@d365-agent/odataclient`**). Enhance user experience for interacting with different agents. Implement self-learning capabilities based on aggregate telemetry. Prepare for wider adoption across the organization and potentially external users.
*   **MVP:** Demonstrable performance improvements for key scenarios across the deployed specialized agents, potentially leveraging shared caching in the MCP Hub (`d365-agent-hub`). A functional self-learning feedback loop analyzing cross-agent telemetry to generate actionable insights or tool suggestions. **Multiple agents** (defined in `d365-agent-service`) are successfully used by a wider pilot group, with stable performance and established monitoring/support. Clear plan and readiness for broader enterprise deployment of the agent suite.

## Task Checklist

-   [ ] **Performance Optimization (`d365-agent-hub` repo)**
    -   [ ] Implement caching strategy (Azure Cache for Redis - provisioned via `d365-agent-infra`) for MCP Hub.
    -   [ ] Identify and cache frequently accessed, semi-static data (e.g., config, certain master data) within the Hub.
    -   [ ] Analyze and optimize expensive D365 queries used by MCP tools (leveraging the **SAP Cloud SDK client from the `@d365-agent/odataclient` package**) across different agents within the Hub.
-   [ ] **Self-Learning Loop Implementation (Cross-Agent)**
    -   [ ] Configure Application Insights telemetry export to Azure Data Lake (ensure agent context is logged) (Infra setup in `d365-agent-infra`).
    -   [ ] Develop Azure Synapse/Databricks notebook or Azure ML job for analyzing cross-agent telemetry (potentially separate repo or within `d365-agent-service` / `d365-agent-hub`).
    -   [ ] Implement logic to cluster failures/common patterns across different agents and tools.
    -   [ ] Integrate with Azure OpenAI to generate tool/prompt suggestions (potentially applicable to shared components in `d365-agent-hub` or specific agents in `d365-agent-service`) based on analysis.
    -   [ ] Set up process for reviewing suggestions and routing them to appropriate agent (`d365-agent-service`) / hub (`d365-agent-hub`) development backlogs.
    -   [ ] Schedule and monitor the analysis job.
-   [ ] **User Experience & Proactivity (Multi-Agent - primarily `d365-agent-service`)**
    -   [ ] Refine conversational flows based on user feedback for interacting with different agents (e.g., agent discovery/routing, context switching) within `d365-agent-service`.
    -   [ ] Standardize clarity and helpfulness of error messages across agents.
    -   [ ] Design and implement 1-2 proactive scenarios, potentially involving data monitored by one agent triggering suggestions for another (e.g., Finance agent identifying overdue payments, suggesting Sales agent follow-up). Requires coordination between agent flows (`d365-agent-service`) and potentially new tools (`d365-agent-hub`).
-   [ ] **Security & Governance**
    -   [ ] Conduct security review of the architecture and implementation across all repositories (`d365-agent-infra`, `d365-agent-hub`, `d365-agent-service`, etc.).
    -   [ ] Fine-tune permissions and access control (Azure RBAC via `d365-agent-infra`, potentially D365 roles), considering roles across different agent functionalities (internal vs. external users).
    -   [ ] Implement robust authentication and onboarding for external users, potentially tailored by the primary agent they interact with (`d365-agent-service`).
    -   [ ] Finalize monitoring dashboards and set up alerts for critical issues (via `d365-agent-infra` and App Insights config).
-   [ ] **Rollout Preparation**
    -   [ ] Develop user training materials and documentation (potentially in `d365-agent`).
    -   [ ] Establish support processes and SLAs.
    -   [ ] Define rollout strategy (e.g., by agent, by department, by user group).
    -   [ ] Communicate plan and benefits of the *agent suite* to stakeholders.
-   [ ] **Testing & Validation (Phase 4 - Multi-Agent)**
    *   [ ] Implement comprehensive Performance/Load testing simulating concurrent usage across multiple agents (targeting AI Agent Service endpoint, MCP Hub in `d365-agent-hub`). (Test setup potentially in `d365-agent-tests`).
    *   [ ] Conduct formal Security Testing covering the entire platform (Hub in `d365-agent-hub`, Functions, Agent Service interactions).
    *   [ ] Perform large-scale E2E testing covering all major scenarios across all deployed agents and edge cases (Test setup potentially in `d365-agent-tests`).
    *   [ ] Set up ongoing monitoring of evaluation metrics (accuracy, latency, reliability, safety) using telemetry.
    *   [ ] Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with pilot group covering the range of deployed agents (`d365-agent-service`).
    *   [ ] Collect and analyze user satisfaction feedback segmented by agent/functionality where relevant.
    *   [ ] Validate self-learning loop effectiveness (are suggestions useful?).
    *   [ ] Final validation against all requirements and exit criteria.
-   [ ] **Pilot Rollout & Monitoring**
    -   [ ] Onboard a larger group of pilot users across different agent functionalities (internal and/or external).
    -   [ ] Closely monitor performance, usage, errors, and user feedback via Application Insights and logs (potentially dashboarding per agent).
    -   [ ] Iterate on fixes and improvements (agent-specific in `d365-agent-service` or shared components in `d365-agent-hub`) based on pilot phase monitoring.
    -   [ ] Validate readiness criteria for full deployment.
