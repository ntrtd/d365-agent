# Phase 4: Optimization, Self-Learning & Wider Rollout

*   **Goal:** Optimize performance, enhance user experience, implement self-learning capabilities, and prepare for wider adoption across the organization and potentially external users.
*   **MVP:** Demonstrable performance improvements for key scenarios due to caching. A functional self-learning feedback loop generating actionable insights or tool suggestions based on telemetry data. The agent is successfully used by a wider pilot group, with stable performance and established monitoring/support. Clear plan and readiness for broader enterprise deployment.

## Task Checklist

-   [ ] **Performance Optimization**
    -   [ ] Implement caching strategy (Azure Cache for Redis) for MCP Hub.
    -   [ ] Identify and cache frequently accessed, semi-static data (e.g., config, certain master data).
    -   [ ] Analyze and optimize expensive D365 queries used by MCP tools.
    -   [ ] Conduct performance testing under load.
-   [ ] **Self-Learning Loop Implementation**
    -   [ ] Configure Application Insights telemetry export to Azure Data Lake.
    -   [ ] Develop Azure Synapse/Databricks notebook or Azure ML job for analyzing telemetry.
    -   [ ] Implement logic to cluster failures/common patterns.
    -   [ ] Integrate with Azure OpenAI to generate tool/prompt suggestions based on analysis.
    -   [ ] Set up process for reviewing suggestions (e.g., create work items, generate PR stubs).
    -   [ ] Schedule and monitor the analysis job.
-   [ ] **User Experience & Proactivity**
    -   [ ] Refine conversational flows based on user feedback from earlier phases.
    -   [ ] Improve clarity and helpfulness of error messages.
    -   [ ] Design and implement 1-2 proactive scenarios (e.g., agent suggests action based on monitored data like open requisitions).
    -   [ ] Conduct usability testing with pilot users.
-   [ ] **Security & Governance**
    -   [ ] Conduct security review of the architecture and implementation.
    -   [ ] Fine-tune permissions and access control (internal vs. external users).
    -   [ ] Implement robust authentication and onboarding for external users (if applicable).
    -   [ ] Finalize monitoring dashboards and set up alerts for critical issues.
-   [ ] **Rollout Preparation**
    -   [ ] Develop user training materials and documentation.
    -   [ ] Establish support processes and SLAs.
    -   [ ] Define rollout strategy (e.g., by department, region, user group).
    -   [ ] Communicate plan and benefits to stakeholders.
-   [ ] **Pilot Rollout & Monitoring**
    -   [ ] Onboard a larger group of pilot users (internal and/or external).
    -   [ ] Closely monitor performance, usage, errors, and user feedback.
    -   [ ] Iterate on fixes and improvements based on pilot phase monitoring.
    -   [ ] Validate readiness criteria for full deployment.
