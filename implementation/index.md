# Phased Implementation Plan

This section outlines the proposed phased implementation plan for the Dynamics 365 AI Agent. The approach focuses on delivering incremental value and validating the architecture at each stage. Each phase includes a definition of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for that stage and a task list to monitor progress.

Select a phase below for details:

*   **[Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup](phase_1.md)**
*   **[Phase 2: Initial End-to-End Use Case](phase_2.md)**
*   **[Phase 3: Expansion & Multi-Instance Support](phase_3.md)**
*   **[Phase 4: Optimization, Self-Learning & Wider Rollout](phase_4.md)**
