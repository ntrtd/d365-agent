# Phase 4: Optimization, Self-Learning & Wider Rollout

*   **Goal:** Optimize performance across multiple orchestrated business processes (managed by Application Backends / Client Libraries - [`d365-agent-mcpclient-ts`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpclient-ts) or [`d365-agent-mcpclient-dotnet`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpclient-dotnet)) and the deployed MCP Server ([`d365-agent-mcpserver-ts`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpserver-ts) or [`d365-agent-mcpserver-dotnet`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpserver-dotnet)). Enhance user experience. Implement self-learning capabilities based on aggregate telemetry. Prepare for wider adoption.
*   **MVP:** Demonstrable performance improvements for key scenarios, potentially leveraging caching in the deployed MCP Server (`d365-agent-mcpserver-*`). A functional self-learning feedback loop analyzing telemetry (potentially across different orchestrated processes) to generate actionable insights or suggestions for tools (in `d365-agent-mcpserver-*`) or orchestration logic (in `d365-agent-mcpclient-*` / App Backend). Multiple orchestrated business processes are successfully used by a wider pilot group with stable performance and established monitoring/support. Clear plan and readiness for broader enterprise deployment.

## Task Checklist

-   [ ] **Performance Optimization (Repo: [`d365-agent-mcpserver-ts`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpserver-ts) OR [`d365-agent-mcpserver-dotnet`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpserver-dotnet))**
    -   [ ] Implement caching strategy (Azure Cache for Redis - provisioned via [`d365-agent-infra`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-infra)) within the chosen MCP Server implementation.
    -   [ ] Identify and cache frequently accessed, semi-static data (e.g., config, certain master data) fetched by MCP tools.
    -   [ ] Analyze and optimize expensive D365 queries used by MCP tools (leveraging the generated D365 client - TS or C#).
-   [ ] **Self-Learning Loop Implementation**
    -   [ ] Configure Application Insights telemetry export to Azure Data Lake (ensure relevant context from orchestration and MCP server is logged) (Infra setup in [`d365-agent-infra`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-infra)).
    -   [ ] Develop Azure Synapse/Databricks notebook or Azure ML job for analyzing telemetry (potentially separate repo, e.g., `d365-agent-analysis`).
    -   [ ] Implement logic to cluster failures/common patterns across different business processes and tools.
    -   [ ] Integrate with Azure OpenAI to generate suggestions for MCP tools (relevant `d365-agent-mcpserver-*` repo) or orchestration logic (relevant `d365-agent-mcpclient-*` repo / App Backend) based on analysis.
    -   [ ] Set up process for reviewing suggestions and routing them to appropriate development backlogs.
    -   [ ] Schedule and monitor the analysis job.
-   [ ] **User Experience & Proactivity (App Backend / Repo: [`d365-agent-mcpclient-ts`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpclient-ts) OR [`d365-agent-mcpclient-dotnet`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-mcpclient-dotnet))**
    -   [ ] Refine conversational flows or API responses based on user feedback for different business processes.
    -   [ ] Standardize clarity and helpfulness of error messages returned by Application Backends.
    -   [ ] Design and implement 1-2 proactive scenarios, potentially requiring coordination within orchestration logic (e.g., monitoring data via one tool call triggers another workflow).
-   [ ] **Security & Governance**
    -   [ ] Conduct security review of the architecture and implementation across all relevant repositories ([`d365-agent-infra`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-infra), `d365-agent-mcpserver-*`, `d365-agent-mcpclient-*`, App Backends, `d365-agent-functions`).
    -   [ ] Fine-tune permissions and access control (Azure RBAC via [`d365-agent-infra`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-infra), potentially D365 roles).
    -   [ ] Implement robust authentication and onboarding for wider user groups or external users via Application Backends.
    -   [ ] Finalize monitoring dashboards and set up alerts for critical issues (via [`d365-agent-infra`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent-infra) and App Insights config).
-   [ ] **Rollout Preparation**
    -   [ ] Develop user training materials and documentation (potentially in [`d365-agent`](https://github.com/ntrtd/d365-agent) repo).
    -   [ ] Establish support processes and SLAs.
    -   [ ] Define rollout strategy (e.g., by business process, by department).
    -   [ ] Communicate plan and benefits to stakeholders.
-   [ ] **Testing & Validation (Phase 4)**
    *   [ ] Implement comprehensive Performance/Load testing simulating concurrent usage across multiple business processes (targeting Application Backend endpoints and the deployed MCP Server `d365-agent-mcpserver-*`). (**Test setup TBD, maybe `d365-agent-tests`**)
    *   [ ] Conduct formal Security Testing covering the entire platform.
    *   [ ] Perform large-scale E2E testing covering all major scenarios and edge cases. (**Test setup TBD, maybe `d365-agent-tests`**)
    *   [ ] Set up ongoing monitoring of evaluation metrics (accuracy, latency, reliability, safety) using telemetry.
    *   [ ] Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with pilot group covering the range of implemented business processes.
    *   [ ] Collect and analyze user satisfaction feedback.
    *   [ ] Validate self-learning loop effectiveness (are suggestions useful?).
    *   [ ] Final validation against all requirements and exit criteria.
-   [ ] **Pilot Rollout & Monitoring**
    -   [ ] Onboard a larger group of pilot users across different business processes.
    -   [ ] Closely monitor performance, usage, errors, and user feedback via Application Insights and logs.
    -   [ ] Iterate on fixes and improvements (orchestration logic in `d365-agent-mcpclient-*` / App Backends or MCP server tools in `d365-agent-mcpserver-*`) based on pilot phase monitoring.
    *   [ ] Validate readiness criteria for full deployment.
